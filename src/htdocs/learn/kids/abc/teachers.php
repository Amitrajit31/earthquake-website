How you share it will depend on the age of the child, the setting, and your personal way of responding to books. You may wish to skip around informally or you may choose to read straight through and return to favorite parts for discussion. This guide suggests possible ways to use the book in a classroom setting. It would be useful to peruse the glossary (<a href="parents/">Parent's Guide to Earthquakes</a> ) to gain some background before you read the book to the class; then you could add bits of appropriate information when you pause to discuss children's questions or comments. The bullets below indicate questions or challenges you might pose to your students. You will need to decide which are appropriate for the students you teach.</p><h2>Before You Read</h3><ul>  <li>Read or paraphrase the portion of the preface that tells why this book was written.</li>  <li>Does this book remind you of any projects you've done before?</li>  <li>What are some words you think of when you hear the word "earthquake"?

In which group would (your chosen word) be? Can you sort other words into these three categories?  </li>  <li>    What do you know about this word that the author didn't say? What else would you write if you were the author of this page?  </li>  <li>Pick an earthquake science word to research and write about.</li>  <li>    Make a model of one of the science words. See Baker: Make it Work! Earth for useful ideas on modeling several concepts in this book. Refer also to "Jello" in the glossary.  </li>  <li>   Pick a feeling word to explore through poetry.
