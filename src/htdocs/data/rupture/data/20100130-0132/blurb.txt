Both the PGA and PGV solutions have updip rupture directions; both the PGA and PGV rupture velocities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;). Both inversions indicate the NS striking nodal plane is the fault plane. This rupture direction is distinct from the updip ruptures that we obtain for most strike-slip earthquakes at the Geysers. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 65 km of the epicenter.
