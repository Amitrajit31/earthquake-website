The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and very poorly well-constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations and the downdip rupture directions. Both rupture directions are partially downdip and favor the N-S striking nodal plane as the fault plane, which is the auxiliary plane to the Mendocino Fracture Zone. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
