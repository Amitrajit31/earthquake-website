00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.000
The United States Geological Survey
welcomes you to the San Francisco Bay Area

2
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.720
San Francisco is the traditional focal point
of the San Francisco Bay Area

3
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.420
The estimated population of San Francisco
is 740,000 people

4
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.880
With nearly 16,000 people per square mile

5
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.730
San Francisco is the second most
densely populated major American city

6
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.780
The San Francisco Bay Area,
also known as the "Bay Area"

7
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.780
is the metropolitan region that surrounds

8
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.030
the San Francisco Bay in Northern California

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.450
It encompasses the cities of
San Francisco, San JosÃ©,

1
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.020
Oakland, their suburbs, and also the North Bay

1
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.410
Silicon Valley is located in
the southern Bay Area

1
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.520
Thousands of high technology companies

1
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160
are headquartered either in
or near Silicon Valley

1
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.000
the high-tech hub of the nation

1
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.720
The Bay Area is comprised of cities, towns,

1
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.590
universities,

1
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.010
military bases, airports,
and associated regional, state and

1
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.240
national parks sprawled over nine counties

1
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.670
The USGS Western Region Center
is located 50 km

2
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.080
south of San Francisco
in the city of Menlo Park

2
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.510
which has a population of approximately
31,000 people

2
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.160
The Menlo Park Science Center

2
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.420
has been the flagship research
center for the USGS

2
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.600
in the western United States
for more than 50 years

2
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.820
It is the largest USGS research center

2
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.790
in the West

2
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.150
and houses extensive laboratories,

2
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
scientific infrastructure, and library facilities

2
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.110
Since its establishment in 1954,

3
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
the USGS facilities in the Menlo Park area

3
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.310
have been home to numerous scientists
and research teams

3
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.090
whose work has done much
to advance the understanding

3
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.370
of the Earth

3
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.530
My name is Rufus Catchings

3
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.760
I'm Chief Scientist of

3
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:12.061
the Earthquake Hazards Team

3
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.330
here in Menlo Park

3
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.440
The Earthquake Hazards Team does
research related

3
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.650
to earthquakes throughout the
western United States

4
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.140
We monitor earthquakes from
the Canadian Border

4
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.090
all the way down to Mexico

4
00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.259
California, Oregon, Washington

4
00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:28.606
Our principle goals are to
understand earthquakes

4
00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:29.608
what makes them happen,

4
00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:33.943
try to understand, possibly,
what triggers an earthquake,

4
00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:36.152
when we are likely to have one,

4
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.398
but more importantly to understand

4
00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:41.467
when and where and what will be the hazard

4
00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:44.642
and how can we minimize those
hazards related to earthquakes

5
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.390
It was here in Menlo Park that in the 1960s

5
00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:51.593
a basic research project on
the Earth's magnetic field

5
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.150
laid the foundation for what became
a revolution in the earth sciences

5
00:02:55.263 --> 00:03:00.263
a revolution we now call plate tectonics

5
00:03:00.977 --> 00:03:05.977
Scientists in Menlo Park conduct a wide
array of both basic and applied science

5
00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:09.839
usually in collaboration with scientists
from outside the Center

5
00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.295
Scientific research and natural-hazard
assessments are critical

5
00:03:13.982 --> 00:03:18.182
to effective mitigation planning,
short-term forecasting,

5
00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:19.832
and event response

5
00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.597
As a geologist I am interested

6
00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:23.542
in the relationship between

6
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.378
earthquakes and plate tectonics

6
00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:27.498
The San Andreas Fault is a
major plate boundary

6
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.660
and I've been investigating how

6
00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:31.687
that boundary changes through geologic time

6
00:03:31.136 --> 00:03:33.136
which means over the last

6
00:03:32.643 --> 00:03:34.643
several million years

6
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:38.248
I just finished a study of this
that includes an animation

6
00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:40.146
that shows how the geography of California

6
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:41.942
has changed through time

7
00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:44.016
I am currently working on

7
00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:45.752
applying this broad knowledge

7
00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.959
to the modern San Andreas Fault

7
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:48.321
in particular

7
00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:50.102
I am interested in the northern end
of the San Andreas Fault

7
00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:51.947
and how the fault slip ends

7
00:03:51.552 --> 00:03:54.552
where it goes at the end of the
San Andreas Fault

7
00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.879
where it is very new and poorly defined

7
00:03:57.818 --> 00:04:04.418
As the Nation's largest water, earth, and
biological science and civilian mapping agency

7
00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:09.524
the USGS collects, monitors,
analyzes, and provides

8
00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:14.995
scientific understanding about natural
resource conditions, issues, and problems

8
00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:20.373
Our team has two or three main themes

8
00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:21.215
They are

8
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:22.641
coastal hazards

8
00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:25.497
which include coastal erosion,

8
00:04:24.321 --> 00:04:28.321
landslides, coral reef bleaching,

8
00:04:28.107 --> 00:04:30.607
and other things

8
00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:32.424
And coastal mapping

8
00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:37.322
We collect lots of high-resolution
maps in our coastal seas

8
00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:40.324
and deep oceans around the United States

9
00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:45.433
The Menlo Park as well as the
USGS Reston library are designated

9
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.700
as official depositories for selected
U.S. Government publications

9
00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:53.788
This branch of the USGS library
collection covers

9
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:56.761
earth sciences with emphasis on Western U.S.

9
00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:59.817
and the Circum-Pacific area

9
00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:05.848
In addition to the standard
USGS topographical maps,

9
00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:10.224
the USGS map sales office has a
number of educational posters

9
00:05:09.446 --> 00:05:12.746
and USGS publications for sale

9
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:18.061
Also, a large variety of pamphlets and
brochures on various earth-science topics

9
00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:20.587
are available at no cost

1
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:28.021
The USGS currently employs about 600 people
at their Middlefield Road campus in Menlo Park

1
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920
Their findings have helped to find

1
00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:33.269
mineral and energy resources,

1
00:05:32.762 --> 00:05:35.062
solve environmental problems,

1
00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:38.942
and make society safer from natural hazards

1
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.779
We have a group of scientists here

1
00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:45.737
who do work on water resource studies

1
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.490
Some of the topics that we work on are:

1
00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:51.723
the role of climate change on water resources,

1
00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:57.166
we also study the role of streams and rivers
and how they interact with ground water,

1
00:05:56.754 --> 00:06:02.754
and finally we have a big program here
looking at the ecology and the water resources

1
00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:04.365
of San Francisco Bay

1
00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:09.615
The USGS has made great
efforts to bring the excitement

1
00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:11.429
and understanding of science

1
00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:15.207
to decision-makers and the public,
so that they can better appreciate

1
00:06:15.114 --> 00:06:18.214
the Earth we live on and
make more informed decisions

1
00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:21.087
about land use and natural hazards
