The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) but well-constrained. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and strongly favor the SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 75 km of the fault.
