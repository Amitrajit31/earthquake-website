The PGA and PGV directivities are weak and moderate (&nu; ~ 0.4 and 0.8&beta;) and very poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and favor the SW dipping nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
