The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.75&beta;).  The rupture directions are similar and clearly identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Green Valley fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
