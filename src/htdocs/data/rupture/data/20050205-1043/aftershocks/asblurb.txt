The first figure below is a map, the second figure is a cross-section.  The map shows the epicenters and magnitudes of the east of San Jose main shock (large magenta circle), two weeks of aftershocks (smaller magenta circles), and 10 years of background seismicity (blue circles).  The red lines are mapped faults, and the colored background indicates elevation.  The dashed brown lines contain the earthquakes whose hypocenters are plotted as a function of depth and distance along strike in the cross-section.  The dashed ellipses approximate the rupture area of the earthquake, as inferred from the M4.4 magnitude and the PGA rupture directivity (magenta) and the PGV rupture directivity (dark blue).  For this earthquake, the PGA rupture direction is similar to the offset of the aftershocks, but is slightly more updip.
