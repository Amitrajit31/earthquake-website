      Lava is rock that is so hot that it melts and becomes a liquid. Lava is present only in isolated spots called volcanoes. We have no active volcanoes in southern California (see <a href="v.php">Volcano</a>.)es, even modern buildings will be damaged.  Thus, our worst modern earthquake killed only about 60 people (much less than 10% of the number murdered each year in Los Angeles) but did $20 billion in damage.
