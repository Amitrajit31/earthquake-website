  The central U.S. is not the usual location for large earthquakes in the U.S., but if you were living near the Mississippi River between Memphis and St Louis in 1811-1812, you may have begged to differ. Three large earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone between December 1811 and February of 1812 shook a huge area from the mid-West to the East Coast. Historical accounts, as well as many scientific studies, have established their approximate locations (see map) and magnitudes (~M7+). Details of past earthquakes are difficult to come by in this area where evidence of shaking has long since been eroded or covered by sediments from the Mississippi River, or modified by farming. Older earthquakes are even harder to pin down, but evidence from trenching and liquefaction studies have documented evidence for three or four large earthquakes since 4400 years ago. The most recent three earthquakes occurred in the past 1100 years, occurring roughly 550 years apart. Does the recent 550-year recurrence pattern extend into the past? And will it extend into the future? Placing constraints on the timing of past earthquakes is essential for estimating the future earthquake hazard in this region. However, clues regarding past earthquakes are few and far between in this setting.

  Some interesting features on new high-resolution lidar datasets (<a href="https://opentopography.org/">Open Topography</a> and <a href="http://tngis.org/lidar">Tennessee GIS</a>) in northwestern Tennessee along the eastern margin of the Mississippi River floodplain recently captured the attention of some USGS scientists. The features are geologic cracks and scarps, called sackungen, on bluffs near the Reelfoot fault in the New Madrid seismic zone (One is a sackung, many are sackungen.) The scientists’ research indicates that the sackungen were likely created by strong shaking from earthquakes on the Reelfoot fault and record evidence for four major earthquakes in this region.

  Examples of sackung mapping (locations in Fig. 1b). a) Sackungen manifest as troughs, scarps, fissures, and benches on ridge crests and upper ridge flanks. b) Sackung features abruptly end at a farming boundary; therefore, sackung mapping is limited to locations where extensive anthropogenic modification is absent. c) Ridge cross-section (location in 2a) showing schematic representation of one possible sackung failure geometry at depth (red lines).

  Sackungen have been observed in many places around the world, and were once thought to be formed only by the process of deglaciation, or the melting of glaciers. However, the bluffs with sackungen in the New Madrid area were not glaciated, and the USGS scientists looking at the new lidar data noticed that the sackungen were only on the ridges near the Reelfoot fault, even though the bluffs span from the southern to northern borders of Tennessee.
</p>
<p>
  Careful mapping of 1762 sackung features showed them to be generally &lt;1.5 m (&lt;5 ft) high, 5 to 335 m (16 to 1100 ft) long, and as wide as ~5 m (16 ft). They are present only within 15 km (9 mi) of the Reelfoot reverse fault, and 85% are within 5 km (3 mi) of the fault. They appear on both sides of the fault, but are dominantly on the hanging wall, which typically shakes more during an earthquake on a reverse fault. The sackungen are visible in the topmost sediments which have been dated to between 11,000 and 30,000 years old, which puts a maximum limit on the sackungen ages.
</p>
<p>
  The amount of shaking required to create the sackungen in this location were estimated to be about 0.33g (1/3 the force of gravity) . Since the shaking from the February 23, 1812 event on the Reelfoot fault has been estimated to be 1.4-1.5g, that earthquake, and others before it, was large enough to have caused the sackungen to open. A question left for future research is why the sackungen only occurred very near the fault, but larger landslides from the same earthquake have been detected by previous studies further away from the fault. It’s possible that other causes besides shaking, like small amounts of deformation near the fault but below the surface, contributed to the limited area of the sackungen but not widespread large landsliding.

  Schematic locations, spatial densities, map distribution, and orientations of coseismic sackungen based on the New Madrid seismic zone. Reverse faulting produces ridgetop sackungen with higher densities and at greater distances from the fault trace in the hanging wall than in the footwall. Strike-slip faulting produces ridgetop sackungen having equal densities and distances on both sides of the fault, with a smaller overall distance from the fault trace than a reverse fault. Strong fault-normal shaking and/or static shear strain produces fault-parallel sackungen with fault-normal spreading for reverse and strike-slip faults. Grey shading darkens with increased deformation/static shear strain.

  In a related study to further investigate the possibility of earthquake-produced sackungen, USGS scientists dug a trench across an especially well-preserved sackung to date the sediments and geologic features. The trench exposed the bluff sediments that were deposited between 4400 and 11,000 years ago. Importantly, this investigation represents the longest earthquake record determined for Reelfoot fault. They found a sedimentary record of four episodes of sackung movement, with the oldest event about ~4400 years ago and the most recent in 1811-1812. If the trenched sackungen have recorded all the earthquakes since the bluff sediment was deposited, it means there was a long time period with no earthquakes from 11,000 years ago to 4,400 years ago, followed by four major earthquakes between around 4400 years ago and ~200 years ago (1811-1812 AD). So the 550-year recurrence interval here appears to have not extended beyond 4400 years ago. We’ll have to wait possibly another 350 or more years to know whether or not the recent 550-year repeat time will continue.
</p>
<p>
  These data agree with several previous studies conducted by researchers using different methods. All indications are that indeed sackungen can be created by earthquakes, and maybe not only here but in other areas where the clues of past earthquakes have been buried. In this particular area, these unusual features have contributed to our understanding of the earthquake history in the New Madrid seismic zone and provide a new opportunity to study them. Seismic hazard models may be improved by considering the recent earthquake recurrence intervals as well as the longer-term quiescence. Every new bit of data helps scientists to more accurately estimate the future earthquake hazard in this area of the country.
