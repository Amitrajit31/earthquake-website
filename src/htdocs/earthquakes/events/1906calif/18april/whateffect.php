<p>The 1906 earthquake essentially turned off earthquakes of magnitude about 6 and larger for the next 73 years (with one  exception in 1911). In the 70 years before, there had been at least 16 earthquakes of this magnitude, as shown below:</p>

<p>The likely explanation for this period of seismic quiet
is that slip on the 1906 fault plane redistributed stress
on other San Francisco Bay area faults.</p>
<p> Because most major faults in the area are nearly parallel
to the San Andreas fault, the change in stress tended to be
in a sense to relax these faults. <em>(If one of two side-by-side
faults fails, the other will generally be relaxed; if the
two faults are end-to-end, the second will become more stressed
by the failure of the first.)</em></p>

  <p>Stress changes after 1906 for faults parallel to the
San Andreas. In blue regions, parallel faults are less
stressed; in red regions, more stressed. Nearly all major
faults were relaxed after 1906.</p></div>
</center>

<p>The important lesson here is that for most of this century,
central California has been experiencing a seismically quiet
period caused by stress relaxation after 1906. The region
may slowly be recovering from this "stress shadow" to a more
normal state of seismicity as the tectonic plates continue
to move, and the stresses on the major faults recover to the
values that they had in 1905.</p>
