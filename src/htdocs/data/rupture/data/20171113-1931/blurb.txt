The PGA and PGV directivities are weak and poorly constrained, owing to the downdip rupture direction. The rupture direction from the PGV inversion strongly favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane, while the rupture direction from the PGA inversion is ambiguous. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
