The directivity is strong: both the PGA and PGV rupture velocities are limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta. The PGA direction has a strong vertical component and indicates the SW dipping plane as the fault plane.  The PGV direction is vertically upward and is farther from the nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 60 km of the earthquake.
