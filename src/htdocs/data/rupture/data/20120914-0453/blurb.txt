The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.7&beta;) but poorly constrained. Both rupture directions are nearly updip: the PGA inversion slightly favors the SW-NE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
