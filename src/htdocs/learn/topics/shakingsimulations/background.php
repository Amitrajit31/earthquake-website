    Two important ingredients for computer simulations of
    ground motion are (1) a 3-D map of the earth
    materials through which the earthquake seismic waves
    pass and (2) a slip model of the rupture itself.

    The pattern and amplitude of seismic waves and the
    intensity of shaking at a site depend on the
    characteristics of the earthquake and the geologic
    materials through which the seismic waves must pass
    from the fault to the site.  A new <a
    href="http://ehpm-earthquake.wr.usgs.gov/data/3dgeologic/">
    3-D Geologic Map and Seismic Velocity Model</a> for
    Central California and the San Francisco Bay region
    was constructed in 2006 to provide the computer simulations
    with the properties of the earth materials. The model
    contains the material properties at over 300 million points
    spanning a region 400 miles by 205 miles and down to
    depths of 28 miles.
          </p>
          <p>
    Soft materials, such as unconsolidated sedimentary
    deposits like bay muds and even sedimentary rocks, amplify the
    shaking. Consequently, locations situated over
    sedimentary basins or on unconsolidated sedimentary
    deposits can be especially susceptible to strong
    shaking.  Faults are not only the sites of earthquakes
    but can also reflect seismic waves, sometimes resulting in
    focusing of waves at unexpected locations.

          <h3 class="clear">Slip Model</h3>

        <figcaption>  <p><em>Total 1906 estimated slip for sections along the San Andreas Fault.  The horizontal offset across the fault is given in feet.</em></p> </figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p>
    A slip model provides a map
    of the slip on the fault surface as a function of time
    during the rupture.  For past earthquakes, seismologists construct slip models based on the recorded ground motions and observations of the displacement as a result of the event. For example, a slip model of the 1906 earthquake was constructed from <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/wald/1906/1906.html">
    seismograms</a> obtained at 96 locations around
    the world and
    geodetic surveys made before and after
    the earthquake. These surveys reveal the extent and magnitude
    of ground deformation caused by the earthquake.

    <p>
    The figure at the right shows the final
    amount of slip along sections of the fault in the San
    Francisco Bay region inferred from the seismograms and
    geodetic data.  A similar <a
    href="./slipmodel.php">figure</a> showing the final slip
    along the entire length of the 1906 rupture also is
    also available.

    The Lawson Report, published in 1908, describes in
    detail the shaking and damage observed at various
    sites in Central California during the 1906
    earthquake.  These descriptions have been recently
    re-evaluated in terms of modern intensity scales, and
    used to construct a <a
    href="http://ehpm-earthquake.wr.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1906/shakemap/">ShakeMap</a>
    for the event.
          </p>
          <p>
    Felt observations are often used by
    seismologists to help fill in unknown information
    about the characteristics of earthquakes, especially
    historic events for which seismograms are non-existent or scarce.
    The computer simulations can provide quantitative
    and spatially comprehensive recreations of the
    shaking, but the computer results must be consistent
    with the felt observations if we are to have confidence in them.
    This need to validate the computer results against what was
    already know about the 1906 shaking intensity around the Bay region
    was the reason why it was important to re-evaluate the contemporary accounts.

    The bright red region about 70 km (40 miles) north-northwest of the epicenter (star)
    highlights the region around Santa Rosa which experienced intense and damaging
    shaking in 1906.  Similarly intense shaking near Santa Rosa is also predicted by the computer model
    as can be seen in <a href="./1906/images/sf1906t0300.jpg">this snapshot</a>
    or in the <a href="https://escweb.wr.usgs.gov/content/learn/topics/shakingsimulations/1906/sf1906santarosa_hires.mp4">close-up movie for Santa Rosa</a>.
