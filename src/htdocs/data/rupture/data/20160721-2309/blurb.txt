The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) and well constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the WNW-ESE striking nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
