<p>Just three weeks after the 1906 Earthquake, professional photographer George
  Lawrence snapped his famous photograph, &#8220;San Francisco in Ruins,&#8221;
  from a 49-pound camera raised 1000 feet above the bay with a train of Conyne
  kites.</p>

<p>To honor George Lawrence's feat, and to celebrate the advancements made
  in earthquake research and awareness, the
  <a href="http://www.drachen.org/">Drachen Foundation</a> sponsored Kite Aerial
  Photographer (KAPer) <a href="http://scotthaefner.com/">Scott Haefner</a>,
  USGS geologist, to re-shoot Lawrence's photo using contemporary kite aerial
  photography techniques.</p>
