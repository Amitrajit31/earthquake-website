S. Geological Survey, is a parent of one of the students in the class and had been coming to give weekly earth science lessons. Our most exciting lesson was when a film crew from the Discovery series of the ABC television network filmed a 2 hour lesson with Dr. Jones that was used in their special program, "Earthquakes: The Terrifying Truth." The big earthquake hit only three days later!</p><p>  The Northridge earthquake was a special opportunity to live our lessons. Although Dr. Jones's visits were curtailed for the next 2 months, we continued our studies to better understand what we had experienced. When it was time to share what we had learned with our parents, we decided to use an alphabet book format as a way organizing our information. The children generated lists of words they associated with earthquakes and sorted them into three groups: fact words, feeling words, and preparedness words. Each child selected words to illustrate and define. Later the text was typed, pictures were pasted up and a copy was bound for each child to take home. This edition is a copy of that first book.</p><hr/><h2>Copyright Information</h2><p>  The content of this web site is protected by copyright.
