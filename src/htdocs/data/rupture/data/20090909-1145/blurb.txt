The directivity for this earthquake appears strong, although the rupture velocities are poorly constrained and limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;.  Both inversions clearly identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
