The lack of nearby stations weakens the resolution of the rupture velocity and the vertical component of rupture.  The PGA and PGV directivities are well constrained.  The PGV rupture velocity is fast (&nu; = 0.79&beta;) and the PGA rupture velocity is limited as (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;). Both solutions identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
