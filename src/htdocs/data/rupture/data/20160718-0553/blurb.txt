The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are downdip to the SW and strongly favor the NE-SW striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
