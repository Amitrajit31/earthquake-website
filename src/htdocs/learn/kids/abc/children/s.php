        <strong>S is for SPACE BLANKET.</strong> If there was an earthquake, I will open my space blanked and get in so I can keep me warm. <strong>S is for SAFETY.</strong> In an earthquake you need lots of safety because lots of people can get hurt. Earthquakes can be dangerous when people don't know what to do to protect themselves. <small>- Tishawna and Joselyn</small>
