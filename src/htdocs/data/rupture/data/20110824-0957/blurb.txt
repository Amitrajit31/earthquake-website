The PGA and PGV directivities are very weak (&nu; ~ 0.4&beta;) because of the small size of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are mostly updip. The PGA rupture direction favors the NW striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane, while the PGV rupture direction favors the auxiliary plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 75 km of the fault.
