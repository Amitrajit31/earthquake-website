The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. The PGV rupture direction is almost exactly updip, while the PGA rupture direction strongly favors the west-dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
