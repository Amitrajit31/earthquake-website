                    "At almost precisely 5:12 a.m. local time, a foreshock occurred
                    with sufficient force to be felt widely throughout the San
                    Francisco Bay area. The great earthquake broke loose some
                    20 to 25 seconds later, with an epicenter near San Francisco...
                    Violent shocks punctuated the strong shaking, which lasted
                    some <b>45 to 60 seconds</b>. The earthquake was felt from
                    southern Oregon to south of Los Angeles and inland as far
                    as central Nevada."
