The directivity is strong: the rupture velocities are limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;. The rupture directions are vertically upward and indicate that the N-S striking nodal plane is the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 55 km of the earthquake.
