The PGA and PGV directivities are very weak (&nu; ~ 0.3&beta;) because of the small size of the earthquake. The PGA rupture direction favors the NW striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane, while the PGV rupture direction diverges to the east of the fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
