The PGA and PGV directivities are both limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but adeuately constrained, owing to the depth of the rupture. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and strongly favor the east dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 150 km of the fault.
