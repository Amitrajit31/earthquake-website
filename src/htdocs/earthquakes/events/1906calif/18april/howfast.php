<p> Based on what we learned from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,
                    the best guess is that in places where the offset approached
                    20 ft, it probably took 4 to 5 seconds to move this distance. </p>
<p> This would imply a speed of <b>4 to 5 ft/sec or approximately
                    3 miles/hr</b>.</p>
<p> Note, however, that the rupture itself probably propagated
                    at a speed of about 2.7 km/sec or 5,800 mi/hr. (See the paper
                    by <a href="references.php#wald">Wald and others</a>.)</p>

   <p> "At Point Reyes Station at the head
                            of Tomales bay the 5:15 train for San Francisco was
                            just ready. The conductor had just swung himself on
                            when the train gave a great lurch to the east, followed
                            by another to the west, which threw the whole train
                            on its side. The astonished conductor dropped off as
                            it went over, and at sight of the falling chimneys and
                            breaking windows of the station, he understood that
                            it was the Temblor. The fireman turned to jump from
                            the engine to the west when the return shock came. He
                            then leaped to the east and borrowing a kodak he took
                            the picture of the train here presented." (From "The
