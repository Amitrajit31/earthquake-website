The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; 0.6&beta; to 0.8&beta;). Both rupture directions are partly updip and strongly favor the NNW-SSE striking nodal plane (that is, the West Napa fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
