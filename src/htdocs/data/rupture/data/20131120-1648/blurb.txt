The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.7&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of stations. Both rupture directions strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
