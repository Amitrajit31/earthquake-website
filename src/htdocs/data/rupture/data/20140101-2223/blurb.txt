The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.85&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the offshore location. Both rupture directions  favor the N-S striking nodal plane as the fault plane, in contrast to most of the inversions for strike-slip earthquakes in the region. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
