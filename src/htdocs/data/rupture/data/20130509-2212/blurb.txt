The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.7&beta;), and the rupture directions are well-constrained. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and  favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
