The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to offshore location of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal strongly favor the EW striking nodal plane (that is, the Mendocino Fracture Zone) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
