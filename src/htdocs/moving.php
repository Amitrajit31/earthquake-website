<p>May, 2020</p>
<p>
  Most of the Earthquake Hazards Program (EHP) website has moved to the new content management system (CMS) framework under the USGS website. The new landing page is at the URL <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards">https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The URL <i>https://earthquake.usgs.gov/</i> will continue to bring you to the EHP homepage, and near-realtime earthquake information will continue to be available at the same URL as always.</strong>
