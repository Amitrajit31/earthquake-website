The PGV rupture velocity is high (&nu; = 0.8&beta;), and the PGA rupture velocity is limited (&nu; &equiv;  0.92&beta;). The PGA rupture direction fails to identify either nodal plane as the fault plane, while the PGV rupture direction slightly favors the NE-SW striking plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
