The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly  updip and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
