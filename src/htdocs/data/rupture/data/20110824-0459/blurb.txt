The PGA directivity is limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) while the PGV directivity is moderate (&nu; = 0.71&beta;). Both directivities are poorly constrained. The PGV rupture direction indicates the NW-SE striking nodal plane is the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 110 km of the fault; we increased this distance from 90 km to stabilize the inversions.
