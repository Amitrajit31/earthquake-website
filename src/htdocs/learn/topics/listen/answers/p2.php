  Yes, the earthquake you picked had the shorter fault which gave it the higher
  sound.
</p>
<p>
  These two earthquakes had magnitudes of 6.5 and 6.3 and took place off the
  coast of Northern California, a little bit south of Eureka. The seismograms
  were recorded by the U.C. Berkeley Seismological Laboratory at their Berkeley
  station. While both were felt in the area around Eureka only the smaller one
  with the shorter fault and more high frequency energy was widely felt 300 miles
  away in the San Francisco Bay area.
