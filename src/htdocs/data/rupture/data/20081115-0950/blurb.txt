Both the PGA and PGV directivities are  strong (&nu; ~ 0.85&beta;), and the rupture directions are similar.  Both solutions clearly identify the south-dipping nodal plane as the fault plane.  This result is remarkable in light of the shallow depth of the earthquake and the lack of stations near the epicenter.  The nodal planes are from the  <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/QuakeAddons/nc51211277.ncfm1.html" > USGS First Motion Focal Mechanism </a> and are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
