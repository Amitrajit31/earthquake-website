Both the PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.55&beta;) and poorly constrained.  The rupture directions are nearly horizontal with a slight downdip component in the PGA inversion.  Both solutions identify the NNW-SSE trending nodal plane as the fault plane, with the PGV solution lying exactly on it.  The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere for the PGA solution, and the upper hemisphere for the PGV solution.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
