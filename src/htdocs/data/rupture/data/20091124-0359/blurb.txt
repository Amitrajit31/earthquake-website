The directivity is strong: the PGA rupture velocity is limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;, and the PGV rupture velocity is almost as fast (&nu; = 0.91&beta;). The directions are vertically upward and very close to the east-west striking nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 60 km of the earthquake.
