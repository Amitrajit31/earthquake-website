The PGA and PGV inversions limit the rupture velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), but the fast rupture velocities are controlled by the large positive residual at the closest station.  Although few stations were available for the analysis, both the PGAs and PGVs identify the SW dipping nodal plane as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
