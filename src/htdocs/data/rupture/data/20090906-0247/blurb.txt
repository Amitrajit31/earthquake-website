Because the rupture direction is vertically downward, the rupture velocities are poorly constrained and limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;. This is the clearest case of downdip rupture in the set of earthquakes analyzed.  The rupture directions coincide with the intersection of the nodal planes, so the fault plane cannot be determined. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
