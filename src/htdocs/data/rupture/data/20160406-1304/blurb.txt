The PGA and PGV directivities are poorly constrained. The PGA rupture direction is downdip while the PGV rupture direction strongly favors the SW dipping nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower and upper hemispheres, respectively. All the stations used are within 60 km of the fault.
