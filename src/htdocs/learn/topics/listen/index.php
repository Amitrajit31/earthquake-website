    Two waveforms from two different stations for the M7.8 November 13, 2016 New Zealand earthquake.  The top recording is from a seismic station close to the earthquake and shows high frequency shaking. The bottom recording is from a seismic station far away from the earthquake and shows low frequency shaking.

	When we listen to music we hear a wide range of sound frequencies
  or notes. When we feel an earthquake we feel a wide range
  of frequencies but unlike music the notes are less distinct.
  People describing what they felt during an earthquake may
  call it a "sharp jolt" or a "rolling motion." The sharp jolt
  is due to high frequencies while the rolling motion is due
  to low frequencies. What you feel during an earthquake is
  a product of the earthquake itself, how far you are from the
  earthquake, and the types of rocks between you and the earthquake.
  To learn about this we will convert the shaking during earthquakes
  to sound and then listen to the sounds.

<h3>Converting Shaking to Sound</h3>
<p>
  When a loudspeaker produces sound it shakes. During an earthquake
  the ground shakes. To convert the earthquake shaking to sound
  we make the loudspeaker shake the same way the ground did. But,
  if we really did that the sound would be too low for people
  to hear. So, we speed things up so that the loudspeaker moves
  back and forth much faster than the ground did and then we can
  hear it.
</p>
<h3>Tips for listening</h3>
<p>
	The sounds on these pages require a good loudspeaker. If
  your computer doesn't have good speakers (a subwoofer is best)
  then try using a pair of earphones.

    <a href="source.php"><h3>Fault Length Effects</h3>
    <img src="images/fault-length.gif" alt="map showing a long fault and a short fault"></a>
    <p>
      Earthquakes come in many different sizes which you generally hear described by their magnitude.
      There are other ways to measure the size of an earthquake, for instance we can measure how long
      the fault was that slipped during the earthquake.

    <a href="distance.php"><h3>Distance Effects</h3>
    <img src="images/EQdist.gif" alt="cartoon showing a seismic station near an earthquake and another far away"></a>
    <p>
      As sound travels through the air or earthquake shaking travels through the ground, the waves lose
      energy. And so a band sounds louder close to the stage than further back and an earthquake feels
      stronger close to the fault than further away.

    <a href="rocktype.php"><h3>Rock Type Effects</h3>
    <img src="images/rock-type.gif" alt="cartoon showing an earthquake with soft sand in one direction and hard rock in the other"></a>
    <p>
      When learning about how distance affects shaking we learned that the waves lose energy as
      they travel. How fast they lose energy depends on the type of rock they are traveling through.

    <p>
      It may be easier to hear the small triggered earthquakes than it is to see them. The Landers
      earthquake is far from the seismometer so most of its high frequencies have died away before
      the waves reach the seismometer. But the small earthquakes have small fault areas and
      therefore produced high frequency energy and because they are near the seismometer this energy
      has not died away.
