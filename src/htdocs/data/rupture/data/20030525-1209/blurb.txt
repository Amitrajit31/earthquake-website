The PGA and PGV rupture directions are well constrained and almost directly updip, and both solutions obtain fast rupture velocities (&nu; ~ 0.8&beta;).  For this pathological case, the fault plane cannot be identified, although the PGA solution slightly favors the NW-SE trending nodal plane (that is, the Rodgers Creek fault).  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
