The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.85&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the very shallow depth of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are nearly updip: the PGA result favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane that the aftershocks mark out as the fault plane while the PGV result favors the auxiliary plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
