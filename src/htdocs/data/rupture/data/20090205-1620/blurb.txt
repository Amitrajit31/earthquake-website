Although they are poorly constrained, the rupture directions for both the PGA and PGV inversions indicate the NW-SE striking plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane.  The takeoff angles are both downdip.  Both inversions limit the rupture velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;).  The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
