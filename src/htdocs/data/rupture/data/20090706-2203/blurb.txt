The directivity is strong, although the PGA and PGV rupture velocities are poorly constrained and limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;.  Both rupture directions are vertically upward and close to the intersection of the nodal planes.The north-south plane is slightly favored. The scarcity of small takeoff angles is the result of the shallow hypocentral depth.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All stations used are within 55 km of the earthquake.
