<p> Intensity today is measured on the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/mercalli.php">
                    Modified Mercalli Intensity scale</a>.<em> (Thanks to ABAG
                    - Association of Bay Area Governments - for this table.)</em></p>
<p> Many intensity values of 8 (Moderate Damage) and 9 (Heavy
                    Damage) occurred in a broad band along the rupture and extending
                    as much as 60 miles to the east of the San Andreas fault.</p>

<p> Because of the huge losses in San Francisco, we tend to forget the extensive damage done to other cities along the fault, like Santa Rosa. </p>
