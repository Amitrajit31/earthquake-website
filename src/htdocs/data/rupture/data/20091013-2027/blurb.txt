The directivity for this earthquake is strong, with both rupture velocities limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;.  Both rupture directions have a strong updip component, and both inversions identify the E-W striking nodal plane (not the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
