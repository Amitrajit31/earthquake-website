The PGA and PGV directivities are somewhat different: The PGA rupture velocity is limited while the PGV rupture velocity is moderate. Both rupture directions are updip and northeast but poorly constrained because of the lack of nearby stations. The PGA inversion favors the E-W striking nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 110 km of the fault.
