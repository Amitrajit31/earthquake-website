The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.55&beta;) and poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are partly updip and neither favor a nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
