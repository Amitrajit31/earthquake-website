 <p>The following figure shows the extent of the 1906 rupture seen at the surface. (Slip on offshore segments of the San
 Andreas fault north and south of Shelter Cove is inferred from comparisons of geodetic observations made before and
 after 1906). </p>
 <p> The total length is <b>296 miles</b> (477 kilometers). For comparison, the <b>1989 Loma Prieta earthquake</b>
 had a rupture length of about <b>25 miles</b> (40 km).</p>
