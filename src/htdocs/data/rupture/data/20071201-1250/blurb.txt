The directivity is strong and well-resolved. The PGA rupture velocity is limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), and the PGV rupture velocity is fast (&nu; = 0.89 &beta;). Both are nearly vertically upward. Both rupture directions correspond exactly with the NW-SE striking nodal plane. The lack of small takeoff angles is the result of the shallow hypocentral depth. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
