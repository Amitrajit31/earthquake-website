The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.87&beta;) and well-constrained, owing to the large hypocentral depth and the number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and slightly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
