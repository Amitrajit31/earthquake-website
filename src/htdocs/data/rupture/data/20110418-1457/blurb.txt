The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; = 0.56 and 0.36&beta;) but well-constrained. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and favor the SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane, although both rupture directions diverge to the east of the fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
