The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly constrained because of the shallow depth of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and favor the east dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 50 km of the fault.
