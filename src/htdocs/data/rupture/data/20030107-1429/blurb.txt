Because there are no stations to the south, both the PGA and PGV inversions limit the rupture velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;).  Both solutions identify the NW-SE trending nodal plane as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
