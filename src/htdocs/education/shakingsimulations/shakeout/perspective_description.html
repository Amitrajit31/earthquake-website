  The detailed, perspective views show the ground shaking from a viewpoint two miles (three kilometers) above the earth looking towards each location. In each movie the left panel shows a map view of the area with the fault rupture highlighted in red, the epicenter (location where the rupture starts) identified by the red ball, and the location shown in the right panel labeled in yellow. <b>In the right panel the deformation of the ground associated with the propagation of the seismic waves is exaggerated by a factor of 1000.</b> The topography has been exaggerated by a factor of two to make the hills and mountains more readily visible.
