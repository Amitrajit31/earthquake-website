      <h2>Small Buildings:</h2>
      <p>
        Small buildings are more affected, or shaken, by high frequency waves (short and frequent).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a small boat sailing in the ocean will not be greatly affected by a large swell. On the other hand several small waves in quick succession can overturn, or capsize, the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In much the same way, a small building experiences more shaking by high frequency earthquake waves.

      <h2>Tall High Rises:</h2>
      <p>
        Large structures or high rise buildings are more affected by long period, or slow shaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, an ocean liner will experience little disturbance by short waves in quick succession. However, a large swell will significantly affect the ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, a skyscraper will sustain greater shaking by long period earthquake waves, than by the shorter waves.
