The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.8&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip and to the NW, strongly favoring the NNW-SSE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 50 km of the fault.
