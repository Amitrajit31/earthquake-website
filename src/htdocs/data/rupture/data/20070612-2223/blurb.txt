The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.65&beta;), and the rupture directions are poorly constrained.  The PGV rupture direction clearly identifies the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane.  The rupture direction of the PGA solution is biased by the large residual at station 1864 in El Portal.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
