The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and very poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations and to the offshore location of the earthquake. Both rupture directions favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
