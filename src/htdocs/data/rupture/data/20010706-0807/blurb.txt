Both the PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) and the rupture directions are moderately well constrained.  Both solutions clearly identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane (that is, the Rodgers Creek fault). The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 60 km of the earthquake.
