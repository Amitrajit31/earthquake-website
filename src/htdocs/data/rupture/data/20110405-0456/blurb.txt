The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly constrained, owing to the offshore location of the earhtquake. Both rupture directions are downdip: the PGV rupture direction favors the SW dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
