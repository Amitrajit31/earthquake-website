The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), but poorly constrained, owing to the shallow depth of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 50 km of the fault.
