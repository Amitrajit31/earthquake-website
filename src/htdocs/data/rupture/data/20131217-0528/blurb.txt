The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but very poorly constrained, owing to the offshore location. Both rupture directions are updip and west, and favor the ENE-WSW striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
