The PGA and PGV directivities are relatively weak (&nu; ~ 0.6&beta;), but the rupture directions are consistent.  Both inversions slightly favor the N-S trending nodal plane as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
