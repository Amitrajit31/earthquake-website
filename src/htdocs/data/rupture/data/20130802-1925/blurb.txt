The PGA and PGV directivities are strong; they have been limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;. The rupture directions appear well constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
