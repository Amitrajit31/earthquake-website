The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and well-constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions strongly favor the NW dipping nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 140 km of the fault.
