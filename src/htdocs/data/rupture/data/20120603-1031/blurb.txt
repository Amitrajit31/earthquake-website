The PGA and PGV directivities are weak limited (&nu; = 0.33 and 0.55&beta;) and poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are downdip. The PGA rupture direction favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane, while the PGV rupture direction favors the auxiliary plane. The anomalous felt area for this earthquake, which extends up the peninsula to San Francisco and Marin, also suggests that the earthquake may have ruptured downdip. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 74 km of the fault.
