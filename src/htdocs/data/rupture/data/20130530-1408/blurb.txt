The PGA and PGV directivities are limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;, but poorly constrained because there are few nearby stations. Both rupture directions are mostly updip: the PGA rupture direction favors the NE dipping nodal plane (that is, the Canyondam fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
