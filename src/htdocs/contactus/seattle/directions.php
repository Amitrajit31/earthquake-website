    <h3><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/joan-gomberg">Joan Gomberg</a></h3>
    <img class='staff' src="images/gomberg-joan.jpg" alt="">
    <p class='staff-desc'>
      Joan is a research geophysicist, specializing in earthquake seismology. Her research focuses on how earthquakes initiate and affect one another, the different ways in which faults slip, and earthquake-triggered phenomena in submarine and other environments. Joan works with emergency managers, engineers, and others in the community, and has been engaged in efforts to enhance subduction zone science.

    <img class='staff' src="images/ludwig-kristin.png" alt="">
    <p class='staff-desc'>
      Kris is a staff scientist in the USGS Natural Hazards Mission Area and an affiliate assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington. She is part of the Department of the Interior Strategic Sciences Group (SSG), which was created in 2012 to support decision making during environmental crises affecting Departmental resources. Kris has co-authored the USGS’s &ldquo;Reducing Risk Where Tectonic Plates Collide &ndash; A Plan to Advance Subduction Zone Science&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; and &ldquo;Science for a risky world&mdash; A U.S. Geological Survey plan for risk research and applications&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;.

    <h3>Colin O'Rourke</h3>
    <img class='staff' src="images/orourke-colin.jpg" alt="">
    <p class='staff-desc'>
      Colin coordinates activities related to the development of Earthquake Early Warning for USGS in the Pacific Northwest, which is part of the west coast-wide ShakeAlert EEW system.  He is currently working to get ready for a limited release of the ShakeAlert system, as well as managing day to day EEW-related operations.

    <h3>Brian Sherrod (PNW Coordinator)</h3>
    <img class='staff' src="images/sherrod-brian.png" alt="">
    <p class='staff-desc'>
      Brian is a geologist and is the Coordinator of the USGS’s Pacific Northwest Earthquake Hazards Program.  His research focuses on characterizing faulting histories from the geological record uncovered in trenching and geomorphic studies, particularly for crustal faults.  His recent work has examined earthquake hazards in eastern Washington, and the Olympic Peninsula.

    <h3>Erin Wirth</h3>
    <img class='staff' src="images/wirth-erin.png" alt="">
    <p class='staff-desc'>
      Erin’s research focuses on earthquake hazards, specifically in subduction zone settings. She is currently using 3-D numerical simulations to predict earthquake ground motions associated with large (i.e., magnitude 9) earthquakes in the Cascadia subduction zone, and more generally is studying the generation of strong ground motions by distinct patches on the megathrust (i.e., as observed in the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku, Japan earthquake) and the amplification of ground motions by deep sedimentary basins (e.g., the Seattle basin). She works closely with engineers and social scientists to improve earthquake resilience in the Pacific Northwest.
