<h3>What is an earthquake?</h3>
<figure class="right">

</figure>
<p>
	An <em>earthquake</em> is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly
	slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the
	<em>fault</em> or<em> fault plane</em>. The location below the earth&rsquo;s
	surface where the earthquake starts is called the <em>hypocenter</em>, and
	the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the
	<em>epicenter</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes an earthquake has <em>foreshocks</em>. These are smaller
	earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that
	follows. Scientists can&rsquo;t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until
	the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the
	<em>mainshock</em>. Mainshocks always have <em>aftershocks</em> that follow.
	These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the
	mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue
	for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!
</p>

<h3>What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?</h3>
<figure class="right">
	<img src="images/core_fourcolumn.gif" alt="Earth cross-section"/>
</figure>
<p>
	The earth has four major layers: the <em>inner core, outer core, mantle</em>
	and <em>crust</em>. (figure 2) The crust and the top of the mantle make up a
	thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece
	&ndash; it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of
	the earth. (figure 3) Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly
	moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call
	these puzzle pieces <em>tectonic plates</em>, and the edges of the plates are
	called the <em>plate boundaries</em>. The plate boundaries are made up of
	many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these
	faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the
	rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough,
	the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.
</p>

<h3>Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake?</h3>

	<img src="images/plate_tectonics_fourcolumn.gif" alt="tectonic plates"/>
</figure>
<p>
	While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is
	moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one
	another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally
	overcomes the <em>friction</em> of the jagged edges of the fault and it
	unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward
	from the fault in all directions in the form of <em>seismic waves</em> like
	ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it,
	and when the waves reach the earth&rsquo;s surface, they shake the ground and
	anything on it, like our houses and us! (see P&amp;S Wave inset)
</p>

<h3>How are earthquakes recorded?</h3>
<figure class="right">
	<img src="../glossary/images/seismograph.jpg" alt="seismograph"/>
</figure>
<p>
	Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called <em>seismographs</em>. The
	recording they make is called a <em>seismogram</em>. (figure 4) The
	seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight
	that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of
	the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the
	spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The
	difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the
	motionless part is what is recorded.
</p>

<h3>How do scientists measure the size of earthquakes?</h3>
<p>
	The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of
	slip on the fault, but that&rsquo;s not something scientists can simply
	measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath
	the earth&rsquo;s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the
	<em>seismogram</em> recordings made on the <em>seismographs</em> at the
	surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A
	short wiggly line that doesn&rsquo;t wiggle very much means a small
	earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large
	earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and
	the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip.
</p>

	<img src="images/seismogram_fourcolumn.gif" alt="seismogram"/>

<p>
	The size of the earthquake is called its <em>magnitude</em>. There is one
	magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about the
	<em>intensity</em> of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending
	on where you are during the earthquake.
</p>

<h3>How can scientists tell where the earthquake happened?</h3>
<figure class="right">
	<img src="images/seismic_waves.gif" alt="P &amp; S waves"/>
</figure>
<p>
	Seismograms</em> come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able
	to see the <em>P wave</em> and the <em>S wave</em> is important. You learned
	how P &amp; S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel
	through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what
	allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works,
	let&rsquo;s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels
	faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning
	and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the
	thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the
	lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The
	further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning
	and the thunder.
</p>

<p>
	P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves
	travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves
	follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P
	and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away,
	there will be more time between the two. By looking at the amount of time
	between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph,
	scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location.
	However, they can&rsquo;t tell in what direction from the seismograph the
	earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map
	around the station where the <em>radius</em> of the circle is the determined
	distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the
	circle. But where?
</p>

<figure class="right">
	<img src="images/triangulation.gif" alt="triangulation"/>
</figure>
<p>
	Scientists then use a method called <em>triangulation</em> to determine
	exactly where the earthquake was (figure 6). It is called triangulation
	because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to
	locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different
	seismographs where the <em>radius</em> of each is the distance from that
	station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the
	<em>epicenter</em>!
</p>

<h3>Can scientists predict earthquakes?</h3>
<p>
	No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists
	have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been
	successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another
	earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it
	will happen.
</p>

<h3>
	Is there such a thing as earthquake weather? Can some animals or people tell
	when an earthquake is about to hit?
</h3>
<p>
	These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather
	does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when
	an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works.
