The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.55&beta;) and poorly constrained. Both rupture directions are northwest and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 85 km of the fault.
