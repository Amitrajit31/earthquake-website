Although there are few nearby stations, the PGA and PGV directivities are consistent and well constrained, but the inversions limit the rupture  velocity (&nu; = 0.92&beta;), probably as a result of the finite extent of the M5.1 source.  Both solutions clearly identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
