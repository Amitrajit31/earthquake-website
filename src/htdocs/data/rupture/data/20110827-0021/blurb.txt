The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained. Both rupture directions favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The 52Â° dip of the NW-SE nodal plane appears erroneous: the San Andreas fault is nearly vertical through the Pinnacles, as indicated by the moment tensor for the M4.6 main shock. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
