The directivity is strong: the rupture velocity appears well resolved (&nu; = 0.88&beta; and 0.90&beta;).  Both solutions indicate the NW striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
