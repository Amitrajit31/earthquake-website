The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip and favor the NE-SW striking nodal plane (that is, the auxiliary plane to the subduction zone) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 200 km of the fault.
