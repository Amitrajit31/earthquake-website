The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip: the PGA rupture direction strongly favors the NE dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. Stations HAST, 47403, and 47499 have been added to the ShakeMap station set. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
