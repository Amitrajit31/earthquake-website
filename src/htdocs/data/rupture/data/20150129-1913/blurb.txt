The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of stations. Both rupture directions are moatly horizontal and strongly favor the EW striking nodal plane (that is, the Mendocino Fracture Zone) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. Note that the uncertainty areas for the rupture directions wrap slightly into the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 130 km of the fault.
