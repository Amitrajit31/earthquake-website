The PGA directivity is moderate (&nu; = 0.74&beta;) and the PGV directivity is limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;). Both solutions are poorly constrained owing to the lack of stations in the direction of rupture. The PGA rupture direction favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
