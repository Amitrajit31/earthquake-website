<!--<h2>A Comparison of Analog and Digital Seismograms</h2>-->
<p>
	Here is an image of an analog recording of an earthquake.The relatively flat lines are periods of quiescence and the large and squiggly line is an earthquake.

<h2>Analog</h2>

  Below is a digital seismogram. The data is stored electronically, easy to access and manipulate, and much more accurate and detailed than the analog recordings.

<h2>Digital</h2>

<h2>Seismograms: Analog vs. Digital </h2>
<p>
	Earthquake research has assisted engineers in determining better construction and design of retrofitting of homes and buildings that can withstand the shaking that earthquakes generate. Earthquake information, such as location, magnitude, and shaking distribution, is immediately available within minutes after an earthquake to everyone via broadcast media or the internet.
