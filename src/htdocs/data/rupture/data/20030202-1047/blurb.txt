The PGA and PGV directivities are consistent and very well constrained, as a result of the fast rupture velocities (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) and the excellent station distribution.  Both solutions clearly identify the N-S trending plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
