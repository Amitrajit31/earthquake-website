The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate and well-constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are partially updip and strongly favor the N-S striking nodal plane (that is, the Concord fault) as the fault plane. The rupture directions appear to be biased to the west of the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 95 km of the fault.
