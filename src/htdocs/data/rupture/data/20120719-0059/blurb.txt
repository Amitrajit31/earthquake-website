The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions favor the EW striking nodal plane as the fault plane. An M1.6 aftershock located updip and southwest occurred 9 minutes after this earthquake. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
