The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) because they are unconstrained, as a result of the distance offshore of the earthquake. The PGA rupture direction favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane, while the PGV rupture direction favors the NE-SW striking nodal plane as the fault plane. For such a large earthquake, it is likely that the PGV inversion is more reasonable. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
