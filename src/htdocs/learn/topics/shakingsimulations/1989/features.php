    <h2>Color Scheme in Movie</h2>

          <p>
  The movie shows the propagation of seismic waves away
  from the epicenter, which lies in the Santa Cruz Mountains, about ten miles northeast of the of the city of Santa Cruz.  The residual
  colors indicate the peak shaking intensity at
  locations up to the time in seconds indicated near the
  top center of the movie.  The current intensity, at
  the time indicated, is indicated by <a
  href="../colors.php">shading of the colors</a>.

          <h2>Comparison with 1906 Earthquake</h2>
          <p>
  One striking observation for those who experienced the
  1989 Loma Prieta earthquake's shaking is the
  comparison of the extent and intensity of shaking with
  the 1906 earthquake.  The Loma Prieta rupture was
  about 30 times smaller in energy than the great 1906
  earthquake.
          </p>

          <p>
  The rupture in the Loma Prieta earthquake began at a
  depth of about 12 miles and appears to have ruptured
  a 25 mile long portion of the San Andreas fault. Unlike
  the 1906 earthquake, the rupture in the Loma Prieta
  earthquake did not reach the surface. As in the 1906
  earthquake, the strongest shaking was concentrated
  along the fault. In 1989 the two areas of most intense
  shaking were north and south of the epicenter in the
  Santa Cruz mountains.

          <h2>Shaking in the Marina District and Oakland</h2>

          <p>
  The simulations do not single out either the Marina
  District or Oakland as having experienced especially
  strong shaking. These computer simulations resolve
  features as small as 650 feet in scale. However, this
  means that they do not include the amplification of
  shaking or liquefaction that occurs as a result of
  thin sedimentary deposits, such as bay
  mud. Additionally, the computer simulations do not
  include the shaking at frequencies higher than 0.5
  Hz. Including these additional small-scale effects
  explains the extensive damage in these areas.
  Future versions of the computer ground motion simulation
  models will also include these effects.
          </p>

    <h2>Role 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1906 Simulations</h2>

          <p>
  The 1989 magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake was used
  to validate the computer simulations, because a large
  number of instrumental observations are available from
  that event.  If the models had not been able to
  reproduce the shaking in the Loma Prieta event, we
  would not have confidence in the reconstructions of he
  1906 earthquake. In fact, the simulations produce
  motions that agree quite well with the observations
  from the Loma Prieta earthquake.
