<p>
  Geodetic methods are used to measure movement of the Earth’s surface and strain in the upper few hundred meters of the Earth’s crust.  These data record subtle fault-related deformation of the Earth’s crust that does not generate seismic waves as well as the rapid motion that occurs during earthquakes.  Geodetic measurements have applications for seismic hazard assessment, earthquake early warning, earthquake likelihood monitoring, and research into underlying physical processes
