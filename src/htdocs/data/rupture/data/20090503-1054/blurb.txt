Both the PGA and PGV directivities are  strong (&nu; ~ 0.85&beta;), and the rupture directions are similar, with a strong updip component.  Both solutions clearly identify the NE-SW trending nodal plane as the fault plane.   The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
