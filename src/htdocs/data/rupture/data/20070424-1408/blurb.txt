The PGA and PGV rupture velocities are limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta; and both rupture directions (almost directly updip) are controlled by the peak ground motions recorded at station GDXB.  Both solutions slightly favor the NS striking nodal plane as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All stations used are within 55 km of the earthquake.
