Both the PGA and PGV rupture directions indicate the west dipping plane as the fault plane, but the PGV rupture direction is much closer to the nodal plane.  The resolution of the rupture velocity is limited by the lack of recordings in the rupture direction: both inversions limit the rupture velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;).  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 125 km of the fault.
