The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) although there are few nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Maacama fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere (we apologize for the plotting glitch on the PGV nodal planes). All the stations used are within 85 km of the fault.
