The first figure below is a map, the second is a cross-section. The
map shows the epicenters and magnitudes of the San Juan Bautista main shock
(large shaded ellipse), two weeks of aftershocks (smaller magenta
circles), and 10 years of background seismicity (blue circles). The
red lines are mapped faults, and the colored background indicates
elevation. The dashed brown lines contain the earthquakes whose
hypocenters are plotted as a function of depth and distance along
strike in the cross-section. The dashed circles and ellipses approximate the
rupture areas of the main shock and two large aftershocks, as inferred from
the PGA and PGV rupture directivities and the earthquake magnitudes.
The downdip rupture direction obtained for the main shock does not
correspond with the seismic gap evident to the northwest. The shaded
circles drawn around the main shock and the M3.7 aftershock show the
rupture areas estimated without inverting for the directivity, The two
large aftershocks are located significantly to the northwest of the
main shock: the rupture directivity of the M3.9 aftershock is well
constrained.
