The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.7&beta;), but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are partly updip and favor the E-W striking nodal plane (that is, the auxiliary plane to the West Napa fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
