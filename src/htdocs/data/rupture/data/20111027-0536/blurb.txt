The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) but well-constrained owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are mostly horizontal and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane, although the rupture directions diverge to the east of the fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
