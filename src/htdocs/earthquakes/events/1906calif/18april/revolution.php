<h2>Earthquake Science in the U.S. Before 1906</h2>

<p>The 1906 earthquake marked the dawn of modern scientific
study of the San Andreas fault system in California. Before
1906, earthquake research in the U.S. had advanced slowly
compared to efforts in Japan and Europe. The first seismographs
in the U.S. were installed in 1887, at the Lick Observatory
(Mount Hamilton, California) and at the University of California
at Berkeley. Around the turn of the century, a small number
of geology professors at U.S. universities and geologists
working for the U.S. Geological Survey contributed some of
the earliest observations of earthquake-related features and
compiled the earliest lists of historic earthquakes in the
U.S. Relatively little was understood at the time about earthquakes,
how and where they occurred, or the hazard they would present
to our westward-bound, expanding nation. The theory of plate
tectonics was still more than a half-century away.</p>

<h2>The 1906 Earthquake Spawns a Flurry of Scientific Investigation</h2>

<p>When the 1906 earthquake struck on April 18, nearly all
scientists in California began to assemble observations of
the earthquake and its effects. Professor Andrew C. Lawson,
chairman of the geology department at the University of California,
Berkeley, took the first steps that led to Governor George
C. Pardee's order, three days later, to appoint a State Earthquake
Investigation Commission to unify the work of scientific investigations
then under way. Professor Lawson headed the Commission. Scientists
(including professors of geology and astronomy) from Stanford
University, the Lick Observatory, the Chabot Observatory in
Oakland, University of California, Johns Hopkins University
and the U.S. Geological Survey served on the Commission. Thus,
the first integrated, government-commissioned scientific investigation
into earthquakes in the U.S. was launched. No State funds
were available, however, to support the effort; funding was
provided by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.</p>

<p> The Commission's final report (published in 1908, and now
commonly referred to as the <a href="references.php#lawson">Lawson
report</a>) was an exhaustive compilation of detailed reports
from more than twenty contributing scientists on the earthquake's
damage, the movement on the San Andreas fault, the seismograph
records of the earthquake from around the world, and the underlying
geology in northern California. The Lawson report includes
numerous photographs of damaged buildings, detailed maps of
their locations, and data from surveys of the earth's movement
in the earthquake along the San Andreas fault. To this day,
the report remains a document of the highest regard among
seismologists, geologists and engineers -- a benchmark for
future, integrated investigations into the effects of earthquakes
in the U.S.</p>

<h2>The Investigations Pay Off... A Coherent Picture Emerges</h2>

<p>The 1906 earthquake and the Lawson report demonstrated the
importance of accurate, widespread and repeated observations
of earthquakes, their effects, and the faults on which they
occur. The report provided the basis for much of what is now
known about earthquakes in California. The detailed surveys
described in the Lawson report show that the damage to buildings
in the earthquake was strongly related to both the design
and construction of the structure and the local geology --
the type of soil or rock on which it was built. Maps included
in the report of apparent shaking intensity in San Francisco
clearly show that some of the strongest shaking in 1906 occurred
in the soft sedimentary soils of China Basin and in the present
Marina district -- two San Francisco neighborhoods that would,
some 83 years later, again (and for the same reason) be shaken
hard and damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Other
maps of the shaking effects state-wide show that the soft
soils bordering San Francisco Bay from San Mateo to San Jose
and around the Bay also experienced especially strong shaking.
Geological observations carried out after the earthquake by
individuals who walked virtually the entire length of the
earthquake rupture (often through poison oak-covered hills)
showed where and how much the fault had slipped. Maps of triangulation
surveys carried out during 1906-1907 also documented the earth
movement. This information plays a key role in our current
models of how much (and when) the San Andreas is expected
to slip in the next earthquake.</p>

<h2>The New Knowledge Leads to an Important Theory...</h2>

<p>Among the most significant observations made after the 1906
earthquake were triangulation surveys -- optical measurements
that detect changes in the angles between lines connecting
monuments fixed in the ground. By repeating previous triangulation
measurements, it was found after 1906 that displacements in
the earthquake were largest at the fault and decreased with
distance from it, so that a previously straight line crossing
the fault had become curved. These observations provided the
basis for the landmark <a href="reid.php">"theory
of elastic rebound"</a>, introduced by Professor H.F. Reid
of Johns Hopkins University, who served on Lawson's Commission.
Reid's theory extended earlier insights into the earthquake
process by G.K. Gilbert of the U.S. Geological Survey, who
also served on the Lawson Commission. This theory, which forms
the basis for our modern understanding of earthquakes, describes
how the earth's crust gradually and elastically distorts with
accumulating plate motion until it is suddenly returned to
its undistorted state by rapid slip along a fault, releasing
the years of accumulated strain and, in the process, generating
seismic waves that produce shaking. Before 1906 and Reid's
theory, this basic mechanical concept of earthquakes -- that
the faulting causes the earthquake and that the earthquake
does not cause the faulting -- was not well recognized as
a universal principle applicable to the San Andreas fault.</p>

<h2>From 1906 to the Present -- More Advanced Earthquake Monitoring
Leads to Greater Understanding...and Reduction of...Earthquake
Hazards</h2>

<p>Since 1906, a vigorous earthquake research program has developed
in the U.S. Today, seismographs measure the shaking intensity
at over 1000 sites in California. Geodetic instruments and
repeated surveys track the plate motion and the related stressing
and distortion of the Earth's crust (which causes earthquakes)
throughout California. Data from these instrument networks
are analyzed with the aid of computers. From these observations,
scientists have formed a detailed picture of the location
and activity of the hundreds of faults that make up the San
Andreas fault system. They have achieved a growing understanding
of which faults are likely to produce strong earthquakes,
what their long-term probabilities for occurrence are, and
how intense the shaking from them is likely to be. From this
understanding, maps have been created that anticipate where
shaking is likely to be strong, and these maps guide regional
zoning and land use decisions affecting the location of schools,
hospitals, homes and nuclear power plants. Also from this
understanding, engineers have developed building codes designed
to produce buildings and bridges that can withstand the shaking.
Earthquake research also guides insurance companies in their
formulation of earthquake insurance policies that help businesses
and individuals deal affordably with earthquake risk. </p>

<h2>Significant Advances... and Challenges for the Future</h2>

<p>Of course, there are still major questions about earthquakes
for which we really have no answers at this time. Probably
the most asked question is Exactly when will the next damaging
earthquake happen? At present we cannot answer this more precisely
than by stating the long-term probabilities for large earthquakes.
But when one considers how much we have learned about the
other important questions --</p>

<ul>
 <li>Where is a strong quake likely to happen?</li>
 <li>How probable is it?</li>
 <li>How intense will the shaking be?</li>
 <li>How well will our infrastructure fare?</li>
 <li>Where should we avoid building critical structures?</li>
 <li>How do we design and build earthquake-resistant structures?</li>
</ul>

<p>	-- when one considers these questions and what has been
learned since 1906, it is clear that tremendous progress has
been made. In this very real sense, society today is better
off because of the great foresight of Governor Pardee and
wisdom and scientific insight of Professors Lawson, Reid and
Gilbert, who, in the wake of the 1906 earthquake launched
California into the modern age of earthquake science 90 years
ago.</p>
