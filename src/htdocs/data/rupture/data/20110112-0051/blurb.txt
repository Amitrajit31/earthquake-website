The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), the earthquake may have ruptured downdip or bilaterally. The rupture velocity is indeterminate. Both solutions indicate downdip rupture and neither rupture direction favors the NW-SE nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault). The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the earthquake.
