The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.6&beta;) and well-constrained. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and favor the SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane, although the PGV rupture direction diverges to the east of the fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
