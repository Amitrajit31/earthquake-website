The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly-constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are generally updip and favor the North dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
