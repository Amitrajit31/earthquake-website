The PGA and PGV directivities are both strong, and the rupture velocities are limited as &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;.  The rupture directions are both updip on the NE dipping nodal plane and indicate that this plane is the fault plane.  The directivity is much stronger in this earthquake than in the previous earthquake.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
