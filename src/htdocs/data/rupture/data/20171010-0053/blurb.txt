The PGA and PGV directivities are limited and moderate, respectively, but the rupture velocities are poorly constrained owing to the downdip rupture. Both rupture directions are downdip and  favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
