The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; = 0.92&beta; and 0.79&beta;) but poorly constrained. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and do not favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
