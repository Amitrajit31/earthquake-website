The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, because the rupture is downdip. Both rupture directions are strongly downdip and slightly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
