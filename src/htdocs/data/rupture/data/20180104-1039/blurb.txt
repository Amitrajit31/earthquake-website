The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.6&beta;) but very well constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are downdip and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
