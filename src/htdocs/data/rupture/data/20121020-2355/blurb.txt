The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but somewhat unconstrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault. If we include stations out to 120 km, the rupture directions are downdip, so that the vertical component of rupture appears unresolved.
