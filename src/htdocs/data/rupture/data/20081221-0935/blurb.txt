The PGA and PGV rupture directions have similar azimuths, but the PGA rupture direction is nearly horizontal and the PGV rupture direction has a large downward component.  The PGA rupture velocity is slow (&nu; = 0.62&beta;), while the PGV rupture velocity is limited at (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;).  The PGA inversion appears more realistic.  Both solutions clearly identify the NE-SW striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas Fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are from the  <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/QuakeAddons/nc51213534.ncfm1.html" > USGS First Motion Focal Mechanism </a> and are projected on the lower hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
