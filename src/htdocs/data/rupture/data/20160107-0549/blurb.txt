The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.75&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of stations offshore and to the south. Both rupture directions strongly favor the SE dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
