The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the E-W striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The focal mechanism is anomalous: most earthquakes at the Pinnacles occur on the San Andreas fault, a vertical fault that strikes NW-SE. This earthquake was followed by a swarm of more than 20 smaller earthquakes, most of which occurred at shallower depths. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
