The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly constrained. Both rupture directions are updip, but neither favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
