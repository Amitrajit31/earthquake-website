      <p>The M6.6 San Fernando earthquake near Los Angeles is recorded by 200+ strong-motion seismometers, showing for the first time a detailed picture of how ground shaking varies with time during an earthquake, and also varies greatly from place to place.</p>

      <p>An M7.3 earthquake near Haicheng, China is predicted about 24 hours in advance based on local increased seismic activity and changes in local water wells, and results in an evacuation of thousands unsafe buildings. T he earthquake destroys 90% of the city but with very few casualties, so the prediction is declared a success. A year later an M?.? earthquake happens near Tangshan, China with no prediction, killing more than 240,000 people, one of the highest death tolls from an earthquake.</p>
