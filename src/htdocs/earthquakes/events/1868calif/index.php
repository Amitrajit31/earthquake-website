  Because of its location in the heart of the Bay Area, then having a total
  population of about 260,000, and its magnitude, variously estimated as
  between 6.8 and 7.0, this earthquake was one of the most destructive in
  California history. Property loss was extensive and 30 people were killed.

      <h3>The Hayward Fault&mdash;Is It Due for a Repeat of the Powerful 1868 Earthquake?</h3>
      <img src="images/factsheet.jpg" alt="The Hayward Fault&mdash;Is It Due for a Repeat of the Powerful 1868 Earthquake?"/>
    </a>
    <p>USGS scientists describe the Hayward fault as a tectonic time bomb, due
      anytime for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake. Because such a quake
      could cause hundreds of deaths, leave thousands homeless, and devastate
      the region&rsquo;s economy, the USGS and other organizations are working
      together with new urgency to help prepare Bay Area communities for this
      certain future quake.</p>

      <h3>Earthquake Outlook for the San Francisco Bay Region 2014&ndash;2043</h3>
      <img src="images/outlook.jpg" alt="Fact Sheet cover"/>
    </a>
    <p>Using information from recent earthquakes, improved mapping of active faults,
      and a new model for estimating earthquake probabilities, the 2014 Working
      Group on California Earthquake Probabilities updated the 30-year earthquake
      forecast for California. They concluded that there is a 72 percent probability
      (or likelihood) of at least one earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater
      striking somewhere in the San Francisco Bay region before 2043.</p>

    </a>
    <p>The next major earthquake to strike the San Francisco Bay Area will most
      likely result from rupture of the Hayward or Rodgers Creek faults. New
      models show that these faults are directly connected at the surface, which
      enables simultaneous rupture of the Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults, a
      scenario that could result in a major earthquake.</p>
