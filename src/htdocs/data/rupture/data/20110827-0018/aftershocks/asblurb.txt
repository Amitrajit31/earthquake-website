The first figure below is a map, the second is a cross-section. The
map shows the epicenters and magnitudes of the Pinnacles main shock
(large shaded ellipse), two weeks of aftershocks (smaller magenta
circles), and 10 years of background seismicity (blue circles). The
red lines are mapped faults, and the colored background indicates
elevation. The dashed brown lines contain the earthquakes whose
hypocenters are plotted as a function of depth and distance along
strike in the cross-section. The dashed ellipses approximate the
rupture areas of the main shock and M3.6 aftershock, as inferred from
the PGA and PGV rupture directivities and the earthquake magnitudes.
Although the main shock rupture area fits within the aftershock
distribution, the aftershocks do not mark the rupture boundary and
extend 4 km to the northwest. The extended distribution of aftershocks
may result from the aseismic behavior of the San Andreas Fault in the
"creeping section.".
