The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly well-constrained, despite the four nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip and do not favor either nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 60 km of the fault.
