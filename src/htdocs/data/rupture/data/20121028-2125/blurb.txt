The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.8&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are partly updip and weakly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 85 km of the fault.
