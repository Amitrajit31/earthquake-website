  Yes, the seismometer you picked was on the solid rock. You could tell this
  because the seismogram sounded higher because the solid rock transmitted the
  waves, and especially the high frequency waves, more efficiently.

  This earthquake was a magnitude 2 event on the San Andreas fault near Parkfield,
  California. The seismograms were recorded by the USGS's Northern California
  Seismic Network on two instruments in that area.
