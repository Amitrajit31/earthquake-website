The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) but well-constrained because there are a large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are almost directly updip. The PGV rupture direction slightly favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
