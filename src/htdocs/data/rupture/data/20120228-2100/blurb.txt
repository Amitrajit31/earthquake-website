The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.75&beta;) but poorly constrained. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and strongly favor the NS striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The earthquake appears to be a tear fault in the subducting plate. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 150 km of the fault.
