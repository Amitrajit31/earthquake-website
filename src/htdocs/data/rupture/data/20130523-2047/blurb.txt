The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained: the Lake Almanor Fire Station is the only nearby station. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and strongly favor the WNW-ESE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 85 km of the fault.
