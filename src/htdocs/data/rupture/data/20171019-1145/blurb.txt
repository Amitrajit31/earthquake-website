The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly well-constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip and west and strongly favor the NNE dipping nodal plane. Note that this focal mechanisms is not strike-slip despite the location near the Pinnacles. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
