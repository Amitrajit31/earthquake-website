	<b>
    The mission of ANSS is to provide accurate and timely data and information
	  products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and
	  structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies.
  </b>
</p>

<p>
	This mission serves a basic function of the
	<a href="http://www.nehrp.gov/">
		National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP)
	</a>,
	and drives the <b>four basic goals</b> of the planned system:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Establish and maintain an advanced infrastructure for seismic monitoring
		throughout the United States that operates with high performance standards,
		gathers critical technical data, and effectively provides information
		products and services to meet the Nation's needs. An Advanced National
		Seismic System should consist of modern seismographs, communication
		networks, data processing centers, and well-trained personnel; such an
		integrated system would constantly record and analyze seismic data and
		provide timely and reliable information on earthquakes and other seismic
		disturbances.
	</li>

	<li>
		Continuously monitor earthquakes and other seismic disturbances throughout
		the UnitedStates, including earthquakes that may cause a tsunami or precede
		a volcanic eruption, with special focus on regions of moderate to high
		hazard and risk.
	</li>

	<li>
		Thoroughly measure strong earthquake shaking at ground sites and in
		buildings and critical structures. Focus should be in urban areas and near
		major active fault zones to gather greatly needed data and information for
		reducing earthquake impacts on buildings and structures.
	</li>

	<li>
		Automatically broadcast information when a significant earthquake occurs,
		for immediate assessment of its impact. Where feasible, for sites at
		distance from the epicenter, broadcast an early warning seconds before
		strong shaking arrives. Provide similar capabilities for automated warning
		and alert for tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	To achieve these goals, ANSS will establish nationwide network of over 7000
	earthquake sensor systems, serving all areas of the country subject to
	earthquake hazards and providing dense coverage in 26 at-risk urban areas
	(see map).  Sensors will be located both in the ground and in buildings and
	other structures.
</p>

<p>
	The system will provide real-time earthquake information for emergency
	response personnel, provide engineers with information about building and
	site response to strong shaking, and provide scientists with high-quality
	data needed to understand earthquake processes and structure and dynamics of
	the solid earth.
</p>
