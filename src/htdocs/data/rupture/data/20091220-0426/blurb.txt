The directivity is strong: the PGA and PGV rupture velocities are poorly resolved and limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;. The directions are vertically upward and close to the east-west striking nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 50 km of the earthquake.
