The PGA and PGV directivities are very poorly constrained, owing to the downdip rupture direction. Both rupture directions are downdip to the south and do not favor either nodal plane. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault. We extended the distance range for this earthquake to try to resolve the rupture direction.
