Both the PGA and PGV rupture directivities are strong (&nu; = 0.91&beta; and &nu; = 0.84&beta;, respectively) and both indicate that the NW-SE striking nodal plane is the fault plane.  The rupture directions are similar, with a strong updip component.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 125 km of the epicenter.
