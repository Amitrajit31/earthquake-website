The upper photograph, taken from a tethered balloon five weeks after the great
earthquake of April 18, 1906, shows the devastation wrought on the city of San
Francisco by the quake and subsequent fire. In the city and surrounding region, at
least 700 people were killed and losses totaled more than $400 million (1906 dollars).
The lower view of San Francisco, taken from a similar vantage point atop a tall
residential apartment building in 1996, shows the development of the densely
populated city since the great quake. If a similar earthquake occurred in Northern
California today, after many decades of rapid urban growth, thousands of people
would likely be killed, and economic losses might be in the hundreds of billions of
dollars.
