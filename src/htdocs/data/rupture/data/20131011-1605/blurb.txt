The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the offshore location. Both rupture directions are horizontal and identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
