Both the PGA and PGV directivities are relatively weak (&nu; ~ 0.45&beta;), and the rupture directions are poorly constrained, but both solutions identify the NE-SW striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
