The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.6&beta;) but adequately constrained. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. Both rupture directions diverge to the east of this fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
