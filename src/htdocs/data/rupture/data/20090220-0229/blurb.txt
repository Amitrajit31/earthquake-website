Both the PGA and PGV solutions have rupture directions that are primarily updip with limited rupture velocities (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;).   Neither inversion successfully indicates the fault plane.  The scarcity of small takeoff angles is the result of the shallow hypocentral depth.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 55 km of the epicenter.
