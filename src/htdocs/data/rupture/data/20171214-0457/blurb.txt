The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are  updip and favor neither nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
