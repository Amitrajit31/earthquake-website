    <h5>Seismic Hazard Zone Maps</h5>
    <p>The California Geological Survey has the regulatory responsibility in California for delineating zones of required special investigation for possible earthquake faulting, landslides, and liquefaction hazards.  Their maps are distributed to cities, counties, and state construction agencies to help identify where higher building standards may be necessary for safe development. For more information and access to these maps, visit California <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/CGS/geologic_hazards/regulatory_hazard_zones/index.htm">Regulatory Hazard Zones</a>.</p>
    <h5>Earthquake Shaking Potential Maps</h5>
    <p>To view the expected shaking from future earthquakes on all California faults, see <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/rghm/psha/index.htm">Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment Maps</a>. These maps form the basis for designing buildings in high seismic areas. For an interactive version of the map to explore the expected shaking potential in your area, see <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/rghm/pshamap/pshamain.html">Seismic Shaking Hazards in California</a>.</p>
