The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions clearly identify the east dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
