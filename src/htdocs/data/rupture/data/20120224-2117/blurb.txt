The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly constrained because there are no stations to the west, offshore of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are mostly horizontal and strongly favor the EW striking nodal plane as the fault plane, despite the large uncertainties. The earthquake occurred on the Mendocino Fracture Zone, where it extends to depth east of the Triple Junction. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
