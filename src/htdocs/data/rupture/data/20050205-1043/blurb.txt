The PGA inversion directivity is strong, limiting the rupture velocity at 0.92&beta;.  The PGV inversion directivity is weaker (&nu; = 0.62&beta;).  The PGA direction has a stronger vertical (upward) component than the PGV direction, which is slightly downward. The PGA nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere and the PGV nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 75 km of the earthquake, and almost all are situated to the west of the fault.
