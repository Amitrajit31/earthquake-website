The PGA and PGV directivities are poorly well-constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations and the downdip rupture. Both rupture directions are downdip and favor the NE dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
