        <strong>C is for CORE.</strong>The inner and outer core is really hot. It is the very inside of the earth. <strong>C is for CRUST.</strong> The crust is mostly where the earthquakes happen. It's the very outside of the earth. <small>- Sade and Linda</small>

        <strong>C is for CANS OF FOOD.</strong> You have to be prepared that you have the things that you need like cans of food and water.  <strong>C is for COMFORT.</strong> A comfort pack is a very handy thing because, in case of an earthquake, you'll be safe. Also you'll be in comfort! And if you are far away from your family, you will feel like you are near. <small>- Sade and Donniece</small>
