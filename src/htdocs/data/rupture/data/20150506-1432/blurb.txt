The PGA directivity is moderate (&nu; ~ 0.7&beta;) and well-constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. The PGV directivity is weak and poorly constrained. Both rupture directions are partly updip and strongly favor the NE-SW striking nodal plane (that is, the conjugate plane to the Concord fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
