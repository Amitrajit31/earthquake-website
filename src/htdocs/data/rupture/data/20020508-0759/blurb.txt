The PGA and PGV directivities are well constrained and consistent.  The PGA inversion limits the rupture velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), but the strong directivities are constrained by the large positive residuals at stations to the west of the epicenter.  Both solutions clearly identify the NE dipping nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
