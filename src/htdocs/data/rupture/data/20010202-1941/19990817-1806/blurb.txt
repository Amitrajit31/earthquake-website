Both the PGA and PGV solutions obtain downdip ruptures, but the PGA rupture velocity (&nu;~0.57&beta) is more realistic and the PGA rupture direction is almost exactly aligned with the NE dipping nodal plane. While the agreement between the PGA and PGV solutions is poor, the resolution of the downdip rupture is remarkable. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
