The PGA rupture directivity is weak (&nu; = 0.67&beta;), but the PGV directivity is moderate (&nu; = 0.79).  The PGA and PGV solutions indicate different nodal planes as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
