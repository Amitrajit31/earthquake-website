The PGA and PGV directivities are relatively weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;), but the rupture directions are similar.  Both solutions fail to identify the NW-SE nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
