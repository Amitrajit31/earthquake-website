The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and limited at &nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;. The rupture directions are poorly constrained, owing to the lack number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and favor the NE dipping nodal plane (that is, the Canyondam fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
