The PGA and PGV directivities are discordant: the PGA rupture direction is horizontal to the south-southwest, while the PGV rupture direction is downdip. Neither rupture direction favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
