The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and the rupture velocities are limited at the Rayleigh wave velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;). The rupture directions are poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are approximately horizontal and strongly favor the E-W striking nodal plane (that is, the Mendocino Transform fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
