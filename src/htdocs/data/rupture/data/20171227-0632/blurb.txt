The PGA and PGV directivities are very weak (&nu; ~ 0.2&beta;) and poorly constrained. The PGA rupture direction is downdip, while the PGV rupture direction is nearly horizontal and favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Calaveras fault) as the fault plane. This event has the weakest directivity obtained by this analysis. The nodal planes are projected on the lower and upper hemispheres, respectively. All the stations used are within 130 km of the fault.
