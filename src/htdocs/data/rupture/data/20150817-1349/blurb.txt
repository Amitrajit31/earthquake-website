The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) but well-constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are updip; the rupture directions do not clearly identify the fault plane, which is presumed to be the NW-SE striking Hayward fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 60 km of the fault.
