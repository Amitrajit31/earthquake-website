The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) but apparently well-constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and strongly favor the EW striking nodal plane (that is, the auxiliary plane, not the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The weak directivity in the earthquake makes this result suspect. Note that the inferred direction of rupture corresponds to the direction with the least stations. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere for PGA and on the lower hemisphere for PGV. All the stations used are within 85 km of the fault.
