<h2>Evidence Used in Identifying Routine Mining Seismicity</h2>

<p>
  USGS/NEIC personnel identify mine explosions and roof collapses induced
by longwall mining on the basis of the following evidence:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Computed locations -- Locations of many of the provisionally identified
    explosions occur within or near well-known mining districts that have large
    surface mines, and provisionally identified explosions occur where other
    similar size events have regularly occurred at the same time of day. Roof
    collapses that are large enough to be detected and located by our procedure
    are much less numerous in our catalogs than explosions: they are identified
    by virtue of occurring in groups in the neighborhoods of some underground
    coal-mines that use longwall technology.
</li>
  <li>
    Time of day -- Mine explosions tend to be set off during local daytime
    hours, even if the mines are operating 24 hours a day.
</li>
  <li>
    Seismic waveforms -- Seismograms at a given station for explosions at the
    same mine tend to be similar from event-to-event, both in the relative times
    and amplitudes of different seismic phases within each seismogram and in the
    absolute amplitudes of the seismic phases. Seismograms may have the general
    characteristics expected for mine explosions -- emergent beginning of phases
    due to ripple-firing, no S, presence of Rg phase.
  </li>
  <li>
    Events not reported as felt -- Calculated magnitudes of seismic events in
    some mining districts are large enough that, if the events were earthquakes,
    they would probably have been felt at nearby towns and reported to the
    USGS/NEIC or to regional seismographic network operators.
  </li>
  <li>
    Independent knowledge of operators of regional seismographic networks.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The evidence described above may be regarded as circumstantial , because the
  USGS/NEIC does not obtain direct confirmation of each explosion or roof
  collapse from the mine where it occurred. Furthermore, for many events not all
  types of evidence are available. Finally, several of the above-cited
  characteristics of mine-explosions and planned roof collapses are also
  characteristics of unplanned rockbursts, which are earthquakes near mine
  openings that are caused by unbalancing of rock stresses due to the mining
  process. For these reasons, it is likely that a small percentage of events
  that we have labeled as routine mining seismic events are in fact natural
  earthquakes that are unrelated to mining activities, and another small
  percentage are probably unplanned rockbursts. In our discussion of
  &quot;generalized source regions&quot; we note those regions that are known to
  have significant natural seismicity or unplanned rockburst activity.
</p>
<p>
  Longwall roof-collapses and non-planned mining-associated rockbursts and mine
  collapses have usually have been reported in regular USGS/NEIC earthquake
  catalogs if their magnitudes were of a size that they might affect estimates
  of seismic hazard in the regions in which they occur. Some large and otherwise
  atypical mining explosions might also be occasionally listed in the regular
  USGS/NEIC earthquake catalogs. Information on mining related seismic events
  that have been listed in the regular earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC may
  be obtained from the <a href="/data/comcat/">ComCat Earthquake Catalog</a> (see also <a href="induced_pde.php">Mining-Induced Events</a>).
