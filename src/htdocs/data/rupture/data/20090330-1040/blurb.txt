The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate and clearly identify the N-S striking nodal plane as the fault plane.  The PGA solution has a rupture velocity of 0.64&beta;, the PGA solution has a rupture velocity of 0.82&beta;; both have strong updip components.   The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
