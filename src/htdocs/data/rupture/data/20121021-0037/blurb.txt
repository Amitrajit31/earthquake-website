The PGA and PGV directivities are poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are downdip and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The focal mechanism for the earthquake is anomalous: we expect a strike-slip mechanisms similar to the mainshock. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
