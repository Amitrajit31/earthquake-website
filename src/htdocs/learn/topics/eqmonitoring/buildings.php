<!--<h2>Earthquakes and Buildings</h2>-->
<p>
	Early alert capabilities in some cases will allow some systems to automatically shut down before the strong shaking starts so that the services and people using them will be safe. Such systems may include elevators, utilities such as water and gas, and factory assembly lines.

<h2>How earthquake waves affect different structures.</h2>
<h3>Small Buildings:</h3>
<p>
	Small building are more affected, or shaken, by high frequency waves (short and frequent).<br />
  For example, a small boat sailing in the ocean will not be greatly affected by a large swell. On the other hand several small waves in quick succession can overturn, or capsize, the boat.<br />
  In much the same way, a small building experiences more shaking by high frequency earthquake waves.
</p>
<h3>Tall High Rises:</h3>
<p>
	Large structures or high rise buildings are more affected by long period, or slow shaking.<br />
  For instance, an ocean liner will experience little disturbance by short waves in quick succession. However, a large swell will significantly affect the ship.<br />
  Similarly, a skyscraper will sustain greater shaking by long period earthquake waves, than by the shorter waves.
