        <strong>R is for RICHTER SCALE.</strong> A Richter scale is a measure of an earthquake.  It can tell you how big an earthquake is. <strong>R is for RESCUE. </strong> Rescuers go to earthquakes bacause when  houses are damaged and people are stuck inside and can't get out, usually firefighters come and help them. <small>- Lila and Bryan</small>
