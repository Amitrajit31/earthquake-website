<h2>State-by-State List of Mining Regions</h2>

<p>
  This list contains significant sources of seismic events that are listed in the "Routine Mining Seismicity in the United States", its predecessor "Probable Mining Explosions in the United States", or in earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC.
</p>
<p>
Sources are identified by names of nearby communities.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><h3>Alabama</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bessemer</strong> - Longwall mining of coal is conducted in
        several large underground mines west of Bessemer (Fiscor, 2000). The
        mining-induced events from this region that are large enough to be
        detected by the USGS/NEIC automatic event-detection algorithm are also
        large enough to affect earthquake hazard assessments; they are therefore
        listed in earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC. Catalogs of routine
        mining seismicity do not yet contain events from this mining region. The
        largest suspected mining-induced event from this region that is listed
        in earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC for 1973 -- March 2000 had MB =
        4.8; the largest mbLg recorded for a mining-induced event from this
        region is 4.0 (see <a href="induced_pde.php">Mining-induced events in
        the earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Alaska</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Healy</strong> - Large-scale surface coal mining occurs in the
        western end of the Nenana Coalfield, near Healy (Keystone, 1997). In the
        past, explosions from this coalfield have occasionally been located and
        cataloged by the USGS/NEIC. The largest suspected mining-induced event
        from this region that is listed in earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC
        for 1973&ndash;March 2000 had ML = 3.3. We have not yet begun listing of
        Alaskan mining explosions in the "Routine Mining Seismicity in the
        United States".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Arizona</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Clifton</strong> - A large surface copper mine is situated near
        Clifton. Special analysis of a group of events with computed epicenters
        near Silver City, New Mexico, suggests that most of the epicenters are
        severely mislocated from true epicenters near Clifton. The special
        analysis suggests that the mislocations are a consequence of an
        unfavorable azimuthal distribution of stations recording the events,
        combined with the misidentification of Pg-phases as Pn-phases at
        stations to the north of the epicenters. The largest suspected explosion
        from southeastern Arizona or southwestern New Mexico that is listed in
        the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000
        had ML(USGS) = 3.4.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kayenta</strong> - Large surface coal mines are located on the
        geomorphic feature named Black Mesa, south of Kayenta (Keystone, 1997).
        The source as defined by our epicenters extends many tens of kilometers
        away from Black Mesa proper. The large north-south spread of the
        calculated epicenters may be an artifact resulting from epicenter
        mislocations. This is suggested by the fact that the zone is parallel to
        the direction in which most epicenters are least well constrained, as
        inferred from the confidence ellipses associated with the epicenters.
        The largest suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the
        catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had
        ML(USGS) = 3.1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Colorado</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Craig</strong> - Large-scale surface coal mining occurs south of
        Craig in the Uinta Basin. (Keystone, 1997). The largest suspected
        explosion from this region that is listed in the catalogs of routine
        mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 3.3.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Montrose</strong> - Longwall mining of coal is conducted in
        underground mines northeast of Montrose (Keystone, 2000). The largest
        mine-associated seismic event from this region that is listed in the
        catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had
        ML(USGS) = 3.3. Induced seismic events of similar magnitude are also
        listed for this area in earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC (see <a
        href="induced_pde.php">Mining-induced events in the earthquake catalogs
        of the USGS/NEIC</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steamboat Springs</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal
        occurs west of Steamboat Springs in the Green River Basin (Keystone,
        1997). In addition, regionally recorded seismic signals are produced by
        roof-collapses that are deliberately induced by longwall mining in a
        large underground mine (Walter and others, 1996). Our epicenters near
        Steamboat Springs are probably biased eastward or northward by
        approximately ten kilometers. We have not isolated the cause of this
        bias. The largest suspected seismic event from this region that is
        listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 2.9.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Idaho</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Soda Springs</strong> - Explosions are recorded from phosphate
        mines in this region (Sue Nava, University of Utah Seismographic
        Stations, personal communication). The area also experiences a high
        level of seismicity that is unrelated to mining (Smith and Arabasz,
        1991). The largest suspected explosion from this region that is listed
        in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000
        had ML(USGS) = 2.7.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wallace</strong> - The Coeur d'Alene mining district is the site
        of frequent rockbursts (Sprenke and others, 1991). The largest suspected
        mining-induced event from this region that is listed in earthquake
        catalogs of the USGS/NEIC for 1973&ndash;March 2000 had ML = 3.6. Events
        from the Coeur d'Alene district have not yet been listed in catalogs of
        routine mining seismicity (see <a href="induced_pde.php">Mining-induced
        events in the earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Kentucky</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Hazard</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal occurs in
        eastern Kentucky (Keystone, 1997). Relatively large explosions are
        detonated in cast-blasting operations (Chapman and others, 1993). The
        lower frequency of mine explosions identified for eastern Kentucky
        relative to southern West Virginia may be due in part to the eastern
        Kentucky blasts being less well recorded by stations recording at the
        USGS/NEIC than blasts of the same size occurring in southern West
        Virginia. Location of shocks in eastern Kentucky is otherwise subject to
        the same difficulties as location of shocks in southern West Virginia.
        The largest suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the
        catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had
        mbLg(USGS) = 3.6.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Minnesota</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Hibbing</strong> - Relatively large explosions are associated
        with the open-pit mining of iron ore (Greenhalgh and others, 1980).
        Seismographic data recorded at the USGS/NEIC are not sufficient to
        detect or locate these events. The suspected explosions we have
        cataloged were originally detected and located with sparse data at the
        International Data Center and listed in their Reviewed Event Bulletin
        (REB). Our solutions are obtained with REB arrival-time data plus data
        from the USGS/NEIC station EYMN. The largest suspected explosion from
        this region that is listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity
        for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had mbLg(USGS) = 3.4.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Montana</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Colstrip</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal occurs in
        eastern Montana near Colstrip (Keystone, 1997). We have evidence,
        however, that epicenters of events calculated to lie near Colstrip are
        actually associated with a mine near Decker (see below).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Decker</strong> - Cast-blasting is conducted at a surface coal
        mine near Decker, and most events that we have located in the
        Decker/Colstrip region are probably associated with this mine. We have
        learned that the following events occurred near 45.12N, 106.92 W:
        <ul>
          <li>Jan 05, 2000, 20 02 05.3 UTC (our calculated location is 80 km NNE)</li>
          <li>Feb 10, 2000, 23 04 59.6 UTC (our calculated location is 56 km NNE)</li>
          <li>Apr 07, 2000, 19 03 37.8 UTC (our calculated location is 51 km NNE)</li>
          <li>May 19, 2000, 20 24 19.3 UTC (our calculated location is 63 km NNE)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The mislocation of epicenters is principally the result of a poor
          azimuthal distribution of seismographic stations with respect to the
          mine in which the explosions are detonated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the
          catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000
          had ML(USGS) = 3.0.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>New Mexico</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Farmington</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal occurs
        north and west of Farmington in the San Juan Basin (Keystone, 1997). The
        largest suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the
        catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had
        ML(USGS) = 2.9.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gallup</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal occurs in
        the San Juan Basin north of Gallup (Keystone, 1997). The large
        northeast-southwest spread of the calculated epicenters is in part
        probably an artifact resulting from epicenter mislocations. This is
        suggested by the fact that the zone is parallel to the direction in
        which most epicenters are least well constrained, as inferred from the
        confidence ellipses associated with the epicenters. The largest
        suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the catalogs of
        routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) =
        3.1.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Silver City</strong>Open pit copper mining occurs near Silver
        City, but a special analysis of many of the epicenters with calculated
        epicenters near and south of Silver City suggests that most of the
        epicenters are severely mislocated from true epicenters near Clifton,
        Arizona (see above).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Ohio</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Jackson</strong> - Surface and underground coal mines, including
        some longwall operations, are situated in southeastern Ohio (Keystone,
        1997). Relatively large explosions are detonated in cast-blasting
        operations (Chapman and others, 1993). The largest mining event from
        this region that is listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity
        for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had mbLg(USGS) = 3.6.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Utah</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Copperton</strong> - The Bingham Canyon open-pit copper mine is
        near Copperton (Richins, 1979). The largest suspected explosion from
        this region that is listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity
        for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 2.8.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Price</strong> - The Book Cliffs coalfield is north and east of
        Price and the Wasatch Plateau coalfield is west of Price. The area has
        long been a source of significant rockburst activity, with event
        magnitudes ranging up to approximately 4.0 (Arabasz and others, 1997).
        Some of the mines use longwall technology (Keystone, 2000). The largest
        suspected mining-associated event from this region that is listed in the
        catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had
        ML(USGS) = 2.6.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vernal</strong> - Explosions associated with phosphate mining
        occur in this region (Sue Nava, University of Utah Seismographic
        Stations, personal communication). The largest suspected explosion from
        this region that is listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity
        for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 2.6.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Virginia</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Big Stone Gap</strong> - Large longwall coal mines are situated
        in southwesternmost Virginia. Some underground mines in southwestern
        Virginia and adjacent Kentucky border experience rockbursts (Martin
        Chapman, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, personal
        communication). The largest suspected mining-associated event from this
        region that is listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for
        May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had mbLg(USGS) = 3.4. Earthquake catalogs of
        the USGS/NEIC for 1973 -- March 2000 contain mining-associated events
        from southwestern Virginia and adjacent Kentucky that have magnitudes as
        high as 4.3(MB) and 4.0(mbLg) (see <a
        href="induced_pde.php">Mining-induced events in the earthquake catalogs
        of the USGS/NEIC</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Washington</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Centralia</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal occurs
        in the Centralia-Chehalis coalfield (Keystone, 1997). The largest
        suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the catalogs of
        routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) =
        3.3.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h3>West Virginnia</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Beckley</strong> - Numerous surface and underground coal mines,
        including some longwall operations, are situated in southern West
        Virginia (Keystone, 1997). Relatively large explosions are detonated in
        cast-blasting operations (Chapman and others, 1993). Some underground
        mines in southwestern West Virginia experience rockburst activity
        (Martin Chapman, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
        personal communication).
      </li>
      <li>
        We were provided independent information on three large, southern West
        Virginia, explosions by the company that owns the mine at which the
        explosions were detonated. The times and sizes of the explosions are as
        follows, together with our computed epicenters and magnitudes for the
        events:
        <ul>
          <li>
            05/22/97 @ 20:50 UTC; 2,353,674 pounds [computed O-time 20 49 30.2 ;
            lat 37.970 N; long 81.475 W; mbLg 3.4 (GS)]. Our location was
            approximately 11 km ENE of the independently known epicenter.
          </li>
          <li>
            06/26/97 @ 21:13 UTC; 3,543,443 pounds [The explosion was not
            detected by the USGS/NEIC automatic event-detection algorithm. With
            benefit of company-provided information on the explosion, we found
            the explosion well-recorded on stations recording at the USGS/NEIC
            and computed lat 38.019 N; long 81.465 W; mbLg 3.4(GS). Our location
            was about 10 km east of the independently known epicenter. This
            event was well-recorded by the group of stations recording at the
            USGS/NEIC, but the automatic event-detection algorithm apparently
            tried to associate arrival-times from the large explosion with
            arrival-times from other regional explosions, and failed to identify
            a coherent pattern of arrival-times. The confusion of arrival-times
            from several independent explosions occurring at nearly the same
            time also hinders the reliable location of some explosions that are
            automatically detected by the USGS/NEIC event-detection algorithm.]
          </li>
          <li>
            01/12/98 @ 21:56 UTC; 1,961,275 pounds [The explosion occurred when
            our mine-explosion monitoring was suspended. With knowledge that the
            explosion had occurred we found it in the USGS/NEIC data stream and
            computed O-time 21 56 12.4 ; lat 38.022N; long 81.329 W; mbLg 3.2
            (GS)]. Our location was about 22 km east of the independently known
            epicenter.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of events we have located the Beckley region and elsewhere
        in the central Appalachians have been far fewer in 1999&ndash;2000
        than in 1997 . We believe that this apparent decrease in activity
        reflects the fact that key seismographic stations that were recording
        at the USGS/NEIC in 1997 were not recording in 1999-2000.
      </li>
      <li>
        The largest suspected explosion from the Beckley region that is listed
        in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March
        2000 had mbLg(USGS) = 3.4.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Morgantown</strong> - Longwall mining of coal is conducted in
        several large underground mines near Morgantown (Keystone, 2000). The
        largest suspected longwall roof-collapse from northern West Virginia
        that is listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May
        1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 2.9.

  <li><h3>Wyoming</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gillette</strong> - Many large surface coal mines are located in
        a north-south belt of strippable coal in the Southern Powder River Basin
        that passes near Gillette (Keystone, 1997). The largest suspected
        explosion from this region that is listed in the catalogs of routine
        mining seismicity for May 1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 3.6.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hanna</strong> - Both surface and underground (longwall) coal
        mining occurs in the Hanna Basin near Hanna (Keystone, 1997). The
        largest suspected mining-associated event from this region that is
        listed in the catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May
        1997&ndash;March 2000 had ML(USGS) = 2.6.

        <strong>Rock Springs</strong> - Large-scale surface mining of coal
        occurs in the Green River Basin near Rock Springs (Keystone, 1997). The
        largest suspected explosion from this region that is listed in the
        catalogs of routine mining seismicity for May 1997 -- March 2000 had
        ML(USGS) = 3.4. The largest mining-induced event from this region that
        is listed in earthquake catalogs of the USGS/NEIC for 1973&ndash;March
        2000 had MB = 5.3 and was caused by a catastrophic roof-collapse in an
        underground trona mine (Pechmann and others, 1995; Swanson and Boler,
        1995) (also see <a href="induced_pde.php">Mining-induced events in the

<h2>Names of Source Regions in Catalogs covering May-November, 1997</h2>
  <p>
    For catalogs covering May-November, 1997, epicenters of many of the suspected
  explosions are described in terms of generalized source regions. Use of
  these generalized source regions was discontinued for events occurring after
  November, 1997. Names of the generalized source regions were as follows:
</p>
  <ul>

  <li>ARIZONA- &quot;Black Mesa.&quot; For computed epicenters in 36.0N-37.2N,
  109.8W-110.8W .</li>

  <li>COLORADO - &quot;Near Craig.&quot; For computed epicenters in 40.0N-40.6N,
  107.2W-108.2W.</li>

  <li>COLORADO - &quot;Near Steamboat Springs.&quot; For computed epicenters
