The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of offshore stations. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and clearly identify the NE-SW striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 110 km of the fault.
