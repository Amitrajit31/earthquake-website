The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) but adequately constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
