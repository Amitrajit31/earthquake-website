        Derived from a centroid moment tensor inversion of the W-phase (~50-2000 s; pass band based on size of EQ). Computed for all M5.0 or larger earthquakes worldwide, but generally robust for all M5.5 worldwide. Provides consistent results to M~4.5 within a regional network of high-quality broadband stations. Authoritative USGS magnitude if computed.

        Based on the scalar seismic-moment of the earthquake, derived from moment tensor inversion of the whole seismogram at regional distances (~10-100 s; pass band based on size of EQ). Source complexity and dimensions at larger magnitudes (~M7.0 or greater) generally limits applicability. Authoritative for &lt;M5.0. Within the continental US and south-central Alaska where we have a large number of high quality broadband stations we expect we can compute an Mwr consistently for events as small as M4.0. In some areas of the country, with relatively dense broadband coverage, we can compute Mwr consistently to as small as M3.5.

        A magnitude based on the amplitude of Rayleigh surface waves measured at a period near 20 sec. Waveforms are shaped to the WWSSN LP response. Reported by NEIC, but rarely used as authoritative, since at these magnitudes there is almost always an Mw available. Ms is primarily valuable for large (>6), shallow events, providing secondary confirmation on their size. Ms_20 tends to saturate at about M8.3 or larger.

        Based on the amplitude of 1st arriving P-waves at periods of about 1 s. Waveforms are shaped to the WWSSN SP response. Reported for most M4.0-4.5 to 6.5 EQs that are observed teleseismically. Only authoritative for global seismicity for which there is no Mww, Mwc, Mwb or Mwr, typically 4.0-5.5 range. Mb tends to saturate at about M 6.5 or larger.

        The original magnitude relationship defined by Richter and Gutenberg in 1935 for local earthquakes. It is based on the maximum amplitude of a seismogram recorded on a Wood-Anderson torsion seismograph. Although these instruments are no longer widely in use, ML values are calculated using modern instrumentation with appropriate adjustments. Reported by NEIC for all earthquakes in the US and Canada. Only authoritative for smaller events, typically M&lt;4.0 for which there is no mb or moment magnitude. In the central and eastern United States, NEIC also computes ML, but restricts the distance range to 0-150 km. In that area it is only authoritative if there is no mb_Lg as well as no mb or moment magnitude.

        Based on the duration of shaking as measured by the time decay of the amplitude of the seismogram. Sometimes the only magnitude available for very small events, but often used (especially in the past) to compute magnitude from seismograms with "clipped" waveforms due to limited dynamic recording range of analog instrumentation, which makes it impossible to measure peak amplitudes. Computed by NEIC but only published when there is no other magnitude available.

        FFM modeling provides a kinematic description of faulting including estimates of maximum slip, area of rupture and moment release as a function of time. Results are used to provide constraints on fault dimensions and slip used in damage assessment modeling (ShakeMap, PAGER) and to model stress changes (Coulomb stress modeling) on the active fault and/or adjacent faults.
