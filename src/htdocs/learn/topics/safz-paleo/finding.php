<h2>Finding Paleoearthquakes</h2>
<p>
  Finding these paleoearthquakes requires going to the right place.  First, scientists study the landscape to find places where the faults are active.  Second, they must go to places where evidence for past earthquakes could be preserved – places where the soil and sediment will cover the fault scarp and preserve it for hundreds to thousands of years.  For the most part, paleoseismologists only see evidence for the larger earthquakes, above about a M6, because below that magnitude they are too small to leave a mark on the landscape that is likely to be preserved.  Consequently, paleoseismology mostly provides data on the biggest earthquakes with the potential to cause the most damage.

<p>
  To find direct evidence for a paleoearthquake, first you need to find a fault.  The standard use of lidar (See <a href="/learn/topics/wasatch/collect.php">Down in the Trenches and Up in the Air</a>) in geological investigations has made it much easier to map active  faults. Lidar can cover a lot more ground than a few geologists hiking around looking for evidence of past earthquakes, and its ability to “see through” the vegetation also allows coverage in areas where it may be difficult or impossible for scientists to access.

<p>
  Once you’ve found a fault, you need to be able to see the layers of sediment and soils that have been deposited over time beneath the surface.  Usually this requires digging trenches across the fault.  In the trench you can see sediments and soils that have come down from nearby hills and are deposited in layers, one on top of the other, like a stack of books. When an earthquake occurs along a fault, the layers are disrupted, bent and offset.  As time goes by, new layers are deposited on top. Since layers deposited after the earthquake are not broken, it is clear that the earthquake occurred before they were deposited.  This pattern repeats over the centuries, creating a geological story in the layers and how the sediments are disrupted.  Viewing a cross-section of deposits that cross the fault from the surface downward is like reading a timeline backwards from present to past.  The job of a paleoseismologist is to unravel the sequence of events revealed in the cross-section.

The forest was killed during rapid subsidence accompanying the most recent Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Tree rings from the dead trees provide evidence that the trees died sometime after the end of the A.D. 1699 growing season and before the beginning of the A.D. 1700 growing season. This age is consistent with the date of this earthquake based on a tsunami that was recorded in Japanese historical records. The forest in the background is above the highest tides.

  In addition to trenching, there are some other rather creative techniques for identifying paleoearthquakes. Using dendrochronology, or tree rings, is an interesting way to look for paleoseismic evidence.  Trees that were severely shaken, permanently tilted from shaking, or were inundated by salt water from subsidence, will suffer in health and not grow as quickly as usual for a while after an earthquake, or in some instances, the trees could be killed as a result of a large earthquake.  The subsequent tree ring for that time period will be thinner than usual. In coastal areas like where this photo was taken, dendrochronology can be used to determine when large paleoearthquakes altered the level of the land: during subduction zone earthquakes some parts of the land surface can lower by several feet. Thus forests with trees going along a coast will suddenly die as the roots of the trees are drowned in salt water.
