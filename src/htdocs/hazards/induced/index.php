      The USGS has produced the 2018 one-year probabilistic seismic hazard forecast for the central and eastern United States from induced and natural earthquakes. For consistency, the updated 2018 forecast is developed using the same probabilistic seismicity-based methodology as applied in the two previous forecasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rates of earthquakes across the U.S. M &ge; 3.0 grew rapidly between 2008 and 2015 but have steadily declined over the past three years, especially in areas of Oklahoma and southern Kansas where fluid injection has decreased. The seismicity pattern in 2017 was complex with earthquakes more spatially dispersed than in previous years. Some areas of west-central Oklahoma experienced increased activity rates where industrial activity increased. Earthquake rates in Oklahoma (429 earthquakes of M &ge; 3 and 4 M &ge; 4), Raton Basin (Colorado/New Mexico border, 6 earthquakes M &ge; 3), and the New Madrid seismic zone (11 earthquakes M &ge; 3) continue to be higher than historical levels. Almost all of these earthquakes occurred within the highest hazard regions of the 2017 forecast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though rates declined over the past three years, the short-term hazard for damaging ground shaking across much of Oklahoma remains at high levels due to continuing high rates of smaller earthquakes that are still hundreds of times higher than at any time in the State’s history. These short-term hazard levels are similar to active regions in California. During 2017, M &ge; 3 earthquakes also occurred in or near Ohio, West Virginia, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.

      The U.S Geological Survey (USGS) has produced a one-year 2017 seismic hazard forecast for the central and eastern United States from induced and natural earthquakes that updates the 2016 one-year forecast; this map is intended to provide information to the public and to facilitate the development of induced seismicity forecasting models, methods, and data. The 2017 hazard model applies the same methodology and input logic tree as the 2016 forecast, but with an updated earthquake catalog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2016 forecast indicated high seismic hazard (greater than 1% probability of potentially damaging ground shaking in one-year) in five focus areas: Oklahoma-Kansas, the Raton Basin (Colorado/New Mexico border), north Texas, north Arkansas, and the New Madrid seismic zone. During 2016, several damaging induced earthquakes occurred in Oklahoma within the highest hazard region of the 2016 forecast; all of the 21 magnitude (M) ≥ 4 and three M ≥ 5 earthquakes occurred within the highest hazard area in the 2016 forecast. Outside the Oklahoma-Kansas focus area, two earthquakes with M ≥ 4 occurred near Trinidad, Colorado (in the Raton Basin focus area), but no earthquakes with M &ge; 2.7 were observed in the north Texas or north Arkansas focus areas. Several observations of damaging ground shaking levels were also recorded in the highest hazard region of Oklahoma. The 2017 forecasted seismic rates are lower in regions of induced activity due to lower rates of earthquakes in 2016 compared to 2015, which may be related to decreased wastewater injection, caused by regulatory actions or by a decrease in unconventional oil and gas production. Nevertheless, the 2017 forecasted hazard is still significantly elevated in Oklahoma compared to the hazard calculated from seismicity before 2009.

    <p>
      The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has produced a 1-year seismic hazard
      forecast for 2016 for the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) that
      includes contributions from both induced and natural earthquakes. The
      model assumes that earthquake rates calculated from several different time
      windows will remain relatively stationary and can be used to forecast
      earthquake hazard and damage intensity for the year 2016. This assessment
      is the first step in developing an operational earthquake forecast for the
      CEUS, and the analysis could be revised with updated seismicity and model
      parameters. Consensus input models consider alternative earthquake catalog
      durations, smoothing parameters, maximum magnitudes, and ground motion
      estimates, and represent uncertainties in earthquake occurrence and
      diversity of opinion in the science community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ground shaking seismic hazard for 1-percent probability of exceedance in 1
      year reaches 0.6 g (as a fraction of standard gravity [g]) in northern
      Oklahoma and southern Kansas, and about 0.2 g in the Raton Basin of
      Colorado and New Mexico, in central Arkansas, and in north-central Texas
      near Dallas. Near some areas of active induced earthquakes, hazard is
      higher than in the 2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Model (NHSM) by more
      than a factor of 3; the 2014 NHSM did not consider induced earthquakes. In
      some areas, previously observed induced earthquakes have stopped, so the
      seismic hazard reverts back to the 2014 NSHM. Increased seismic activity,
      whether defined as induced or natural, produces high hazard. Conversion of
      ground shaking to seismic intensity indicates that some places in
      Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Arkansas may experience
      damage if the induced seismicity continues unabated. The chance of having
      Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) VI or greater (damaging earthquake
      shaking) is 5–12 percent per year in north-central Oklahoma and southern
      Kansas, similar to the chance of damage caused by natural earthquakes at
      sites in parts of California.
