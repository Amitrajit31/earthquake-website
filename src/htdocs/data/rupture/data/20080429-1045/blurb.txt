Both the PGA and PGV rupture directions indicate that the SW dipping nodal plane is the fault plane.  Because there are no stations in the rupture direction, the resolution of the rupture velocity is weak: both inversions limit the rupture velocity (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;).  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the epicenter.
