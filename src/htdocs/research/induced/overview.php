<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Within the central and eastern United States, the number of earthquakes has increased dramatically over the past few years. Between the years 1973&ndash;2008, there was an average of 21 earthquakes of magnitude three and larger in the central and eastern United States. This rate jumped to an average of 99 M3+ earthquakes per year in 2009&ndash;2013, and the rate continues to rise. In 2014, alone, there were 659 M3 and larger earthquakes. Most of these earthquakes are in the magnitude 3&ndash;4 range&mdash;large enough to have been felt by many people&mdash;yet small enough to rarely cause damage. There were reports of damage from some of the larger events, including the M5.6 Prague, Oklahoma earthquake and the M5.3 Trinidad, Colorado earthquake.
</p>

<p>This increase in earthquakes prompts two important questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are they natural, or man-made?</li>
	<li>What should be done in the future as we address the causes and consequences of these events to reduce associated risks?</li>
</ul>
