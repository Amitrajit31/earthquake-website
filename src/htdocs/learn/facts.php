    The <strong>largest recorded earthquake in the United States</strong> was
    a magnitude 9.2 that struck Prince William Sound, Alaska on Good Friday,
    March 28, 1964 UTC.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>largest recorded earthquake in the world</strong> was a
    magnitude 9.5 (Mw) in Chile on May 22, 1960.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>earliest reported earthquake in California</strong> was felt
    in 1769 by the exploring expedition of Gaspar de Portola while the group
    was camping about 48 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Los Angeles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before electronics allowed recordings of large earthquakes, scientists
    built large <strong>spring-pendulum seismometers</strong> in an attempt to
    record the long-period motion produced by such quakes. The largest one
    weighed about 15 tons. There is a medium-sized one three stories high in
    Mexico City that is still in operation.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <strong>fastest wave</strong>, and therefore the first to arrive at a given
    location, is called the P wave. The P wave, or compressional wave,
    alternately compresses and expands material in the same direction it is
    traveling.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>average rate of motion across the San Andreas Fault Zone
    </strong> during the past 3 million years is 56 mm/yr (2 in/yr). This is
    about the same rate at which your fingernails grow. Assuming this rate
    continues, scientists project that Los Angeles and San Francisco will be
    adjacent to one another in approximately 15 million years.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>East African Rift System</strong> is a 50-60 km (31-37 miles)
    wide zone of active volcanics and faulting that extends north-south in
    eastern Africa for more than 3000 km (1864 miles) from Ethiopia in the
    north to Zambezi in the south. It is a rare example of an active
    continental rift zone, where a continental plate is attempting to split
    into two plates which are moving away from one another.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>first &ldquo;pendulum seismoscope&rdquo;</strong> to measure
    the shaking of the ground during an earthquake was developed in 1751, and
    it wasn&rsquo;t until 1855 that faults were recognized as the source of
    earthquakes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Moonquakes</strong> (&ldquo;earthquakes&rdquo; on the moon) do
    occur, but they happen less frequently and have smaller magnitudes than
    earthquakes on the Earth. It appears they are related to the tidal
    stresses associated with the varying distance between the Earth and Moon.
    They also occur at great depth, about halfway between the surface and the
    center of the moon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although both are sea waves, a <strong>tsunami and a tidal wave</strong>
    are two different unrelated phenomenona. A tidal wave is a shallow water
    wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and
    Earth. A tsunami is a sea wave caused by an underwater earthquake or
    landslide (usually triggered by an earthquake) displacing the ocean water.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>hypocenter</strong> of an earthquake is the location beneath
    the earth&rsquo;s surface where the rupture of the fault begins. The
    <strong>epicenter</strong> of an earthquake is the location directly above
    the hypocenter on the surface of the earth.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <strong>&ldquo;Ring of Fire&rdquo;</strong> also called the Circum-Pacific belt,
    is the zone of earthquakes surrounding the Pacific Ocean â€” about
    90&#37; of the world&rsquo;s earthquakes occur there. The next most
    seismic region (5-6&#37; of earthquakes) is the Alpide belt (extends
    from Mediterranean region, eastward through Turkey, Iran, and northern
    India.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is estimated that there are <strong>500,000 detectable earthquakes
    </strong> in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt, and 100 of
    them cause damage.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is thought that more damage was done by the resulting fire after the
    <strong>1906 San Francisco earthquake</strong> than by the earthquake
    itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <strong>seiche</strong> (pronounced SAYSH) is what happens in the
    swimming pools of Californians during and after an earthquake. It is
    &ldquo;an internal wave oscillating in a body of water&rdquo; or, in other
    words, it is the sloshing of the water in your swimming pool, or any body
    of water, caused by the ground shaking in an earthquake.  It may continue
    for a few moments or hours, long after the generating force is gone. A
    seiche can also be caused by wind or tides.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each year the <strong>southern California area has about 10,000
    earthquakes</strong>. Most of them are so small that they are not felt.
    Only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0, and only about 15-20
    are greater than magnitude 4.0. If there is a large earthquake, however,
    the aftershock sequence will produce many more earthquakes of all
    magnitudes for many months.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>magnitude</strong> of an earthquake is a measured value of the
    earthquake size. The magnitude is the same no matter where you are, or how
    strong or weak the shaking was in various locations. The
    <strong>intensity</strong> of an earthquake is a measure of the shaking
    created by the earthquake, and this value does vary with location.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>Wasatch Range</strong>, with its outstanding ski areas, runs
    North-South through Utah, and like all mountain ranges it was produced by
    a series of earthquakes. The 386 km (240-mile)-long Wasatch Fault is made
    up of several segments, each capable of producing up to a M7.5 earthquake.
    During the past 6,000 years, there has been a M6.5+ about once every 350
    years, and it has been about 350 years since the last powerful earthquake,
    which was on the Nephi segment.
  </li>
  <li>
    The world&rsquo;s <strong>greatest land mountain range</strong> is the
    Himalaya-Karakoram. It countains 96 of the world&rsquo;s 109 peaks of over
    7,317m (24,000 ft). The longest range is the Andes of South America which
    is 7,564km (4700 mi) in length. Both were created bythe movement of
    tectonic plates.
  </li>

  <figure class='right'>
    <img src="images/midatlant_twocolumn.gif" alt="mid-Atlantic Ridge"\>
  </figure>
  <li>
    The greatest mountain range in the world, though, is the <strong<Mid-Ocean
    Ridge</strong>, extending 64,374 km (40,000 mi) from the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, around Africa, Asia, and Australia, and under the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of North America. It has a greatest height of 4207m (13,800 ft) above the base ocean depth.
  </li>
  <li>
    As far as we know, there is no such thing as <b>"earthquake weather"</b>.
    Statistically, there is an equal distribution of earthquakes in cold weather,
    hot weather, rainy weather, etc.   If weather does affect earthquake occurrence,
    we do not yet understand how it works.
  </li>
  <li>
    From 1975-1995 there were only <strong>four states that did not have any
    earthquakes</strong>. They were: Florida, Iowa, North Dakota, and
    Wisconsin.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>core of the earth</strong> was the first internal structural
    element to be identified. In 1906 R.D. Oldham discovered it from his
    studies of earthquake records. The inner core is solid, and the outer core
    is liquid and so does not transmit the shear wave energy released during
    an earthquake.
  </li>
  <li>
    The swimming pool at the University of Arizona in Tucson lost water from
    sloshing (seiche) caused by the <strong>1985 M8.1 Michoacan, Mexico
    earthquake</strong> 2000 km (1240 miles) away.
  </li>
  <li>
    Earthquakes occur in the central portion of the United States too! Some
    very powerful earthquakes occurred along the New Madrid fault in the
    <strong>Mississippi Valley in 1811-1812</strong>. Because of the crustal
    structure in the Central US which efficiently propagates seismic energy,
    shaking from earthquakes in this part of the country are felt at a much
    greater distance from the epicenters than similar size quakes in the
    Western US.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most earthquakes occur at depths of <strong>less than 80 km
    (50 miles)</strong> from the Earth&rsquo;s surface.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <strong>San Andreas fault is NOT a single, continuous fault</strong>,
    but rather is actually a fault zone made up of many segments. Movement may
    occur along any of the many fault segments along the zone at any time. The
    San Andreas fault system is more that 1300 km (800 miles) long, and in
    some spots is as much as 16 km (10 miles) deep.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>origin of the name of the San Andreas Fault</strong> is often cited as the
    San Andreas Lake. However, based on some 1895 and 1908 reports by
    geologist A.C. Lawson, who named the fault, the name was actually taken
    from the San Andreas Valley. He likely did not realize at the time that
    the fault ran almost the entire length of California!
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>world&rsquo;s deadliest recorded earthquake</strong> occurred
    in 1556 in central China. It struck a region where most people lived in
    caves carved from soft rock. These dwellings collapsed during the
    earthquake, killing an estimated 830,000 people. In 1976 another deadly
    earthquake struck in Tangshan, China, where more than 250,000 people were
    killed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Florida and North Dakota have the <strong>smallest number of
    earthquakes</strong> in the United States.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>deepest earthquakes</strong> typically occur at plate
    boundaries where the Earth&rdquo;s crust is being subducted into the
    Earth&rsquo;s mantle. These occur as deep as 750 km (400 miles) below the
    surface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alaska is the <strong>most earthquake-prone state</strong> and one of the
    most seismically active regions in the world. Alaska experiences a
    magnitude 7 earthquake almost every year, and a magnitude 8 or greater
    earthquake on average every 14 years.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>majority of the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions</strong>
    occur along plate boundaries such as the boundary between the Pacific
    Plate and the North American plate. One of the most active plate
    boundaries where earthquakes and eruptions are frequent, for example, is
    around the massive Pacific Plate commonly referred to as the Pacific Ring
    of Fire.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>earliest recorded evidence of an earthquake</strong> has been
    traced back to 1831 BC in the Shandong province of China, but there is a
    fairly complete record starting in 780 BC during the Zhou Dynasty in
    China.
  </li>
  <li>
    It was recognized as early as 350 BC by the Greek scientist Aristotle that
    <strong>soft ground shakes more than hard rock</strong> in an earthquake.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>cause of earthquakes was stated correctly in 1760</strong> by
    British engineer John Michell, one of the first fathers of seismology, in
    a memoir where he wrote that earthquakes and the waves of energy that they
    make are caused by &ldquo;shifting masses of rock miles below the
    surface&rdquo;.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Subduction</strong> is the process of the oceanic lithosphere colliding with and descending beneath the continental lithosphere.
  </li>
  <li>
    In 1663 the European settlers experienced their <strong>first earthquake
    in America</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Human beings can detect sounds in the frequency range 20-20,000 Hertz. If
    a P wave refracts out of the rock surface into the air, and it has a
    frequency in the audible range, it will be heard as a rumble. <strong>Most
    earthquake waves have a frequency of less than 20 Hz</strong>, so the
    waves themselves are usually not heard. Most of the rumbling noise heard
    during an earthquake is the building and its contents moving.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the Chilean earthquake occurred in 1960, <strong>seismographs
    recorded seismic waves that traveled all around the Earth</strong>. These
    seismic waves shook the entire earth for many days! This phenomenon is
    called the free oscillation of the Earth.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>interior of Antarctica has icequakes</strong> which, although
    they are much smaller, are perhaps more frequent than earthquakes in
    Antarctica. The icequakes are similar to earthquakes, but occur within the
    ice sheet itself instead of the land underneath the ice. Some of our polar
    observers have told us they can hear the icequakes and see them on the
    South Pole seismograph station, but they are much too small to be seen on
    enough stations to obtain a location.
