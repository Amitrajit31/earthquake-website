		<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquake prediction</strong>
			Investigate and find out if anyone has a consistent successful way to
			predict earthquakes. If not, why were they not successful. Come up with
			your own idea for predicting earthquakes, and test it. Explain why it did
			or did not work.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquake myths</strong>
			Examine earthquake myths and interview people about these myths to find
			out what they think. What would be the best way to get rid of myths? Is
			there any group of people who tend to believe myths more? Older people?
			Younger people? Other groups?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Seismic waves</strong>
			<figure class="right">
				<img src="images/helicorder_twocolumn.gif" alt="helicorder"/>
			</figure>
			What types of seismic waves are there? What do they look like on a
			seismogram (recording)? What effects do different kinds of waves have on
			different kinds of buildings?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Seismograph</strong>
			Make a seismograph.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>World-wide earthquake hazards</strong>
			Which areas around the world are most vulnerable to earthquakes and why?
			What are the major problems dealing with earthquakes in different areas?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquake risks</strong>
			Investigate the current earthquake risks in your area. If there are none
			currently, have there ever been earthquakes there in the past? Why, and
			why aren't there any now?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Plate tectonic model</strong>
			<figure class="right">
				<img src="images/LABasin_twocolumn.gif" alt="La basin tectonic setting"/>
			</figure>
			Build a model that simulates plate motions and their effects.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>San Andreas Fault</strong>
			Learn about the different segments of the San Andreas Fault. Demonstrate
			how each segment behaves differently and why.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Plate tectonics</strong>
			Cut a world map along the plate boundaries, and try to fit the pieces back
			together like they were millions of years ago. Observe how each piece has
			moved to its current position.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Tsunamis</strong>
			Demonstrate how a tsunami is created.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fault models</strong>
			Make models of different kinds of faults and investigate the tectonic
			setting of each (where are these types of faults generally found?).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquake-proof buildings</strong>
			<figure class="right">
				<img src="images/water_twocolumn.gif" alt="waterheater"/>
			</figure>
			Try to design a building that can withstand an earthquake. What works?
			What doesn't work? Why?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquake preparedness</strong>
			Find the most effective ways to prepare for an earthquake. Test the
			effectiveness of different types of earthquake brackets and straps, etc.
			Determine the safest places to be inside the house, outside, in car, etc.
			Prepare on earthquake plan for your family, class, school.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Monitoring earthquakes</strong>
			Monitor earthquakes locally, regionally, or globally, and plot them on a
			map.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Locating an earthquake</strong>
			Show how earthquakes are located. Create a fictional story about an
			earthquake and write a news story with a map showing the epicenter.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Stress &amp; strain</strong>
			<figure class="right">
				<img src="images/stress_types_twocolumn.gif" alt="types of stress"/>
			</figure>
			Make a model to show how stress and strain affect different materials
			(wood, silly putty, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquakes &amp; volcanoes</strong>
			Investigate how earthquakes and volcanoes are related.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Magnitude &amp; intensity</strong>
			Show the difference between magnitude and intensity. What controls the
			magnitude of an earthquake? What affects the shaking intensity?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Earthquakes on other planets</strong>
			Do earthquakes occur on other planets? Which ones? Why or why not?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Other ideas to brainstorm</strong>
			Interior of the earth, earthquakes &amp; roads, earthquakes &amp;
			buildings, earthquakes and the Eastern US, &ldquo;Ring of Fire&rdquo;.
		</li>
		</ol>
