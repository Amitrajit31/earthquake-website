The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) and relatively well-constrained. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the NE-SW striking nodal plane (that is, not the Sargent fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
