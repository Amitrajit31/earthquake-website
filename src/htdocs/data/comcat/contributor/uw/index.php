  Damaging earthquakes are well known in the Pacific Northwest, including several larger
  than magnitude 7. In 1965, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake shook the Seattle, Washington,
  area causing substantial damage and seven deaths. This event spurred the installation
  of the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network (PNSN) in 1969 to monitor regional earthquake
  activity. Starting with five seismometers the PNSN has grown to include over 220 seismograph
  stations in Washington and Oregon. The PNSN is centered at the University of Washington's
  Dept. of Earth and Space Sciences and operated jointly by the University of Washington and
  the University of Oregon. It is funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of
  Energy, and the University of Washington.

  The PNSN mission is to provide data and information products to help scientists study Pacific
  Northwest earthquake and volcanic hazards and to assist the emergency managers, press and public
  to understand and mitigate those hazards. &nbsp;The PNSN collects and analyzes data for basic
  and applied research and to provide rapid and accurate information on earthquakes and volcanic
  activity in Washington and Oregon to emergency managers and the public after felt events.
