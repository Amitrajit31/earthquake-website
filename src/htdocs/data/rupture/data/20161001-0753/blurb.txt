The PGA directivity is moderate (&nu; ~ 0.8&beta;), and the PGV directivity is limited. The rupture directions are poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are 27Â° updip from the northeast dipping nodal plane favored as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
