<p>
  The shadow zone is the area of the earth from angular distances of 104 to 140 degrees that, for a given earthquake, that does not receive any direct P waves. The shadow zone results from S waves (not shown in animation) being stopped entirely by the liquid core and P waves being bent (refracted) by the liquid core.
