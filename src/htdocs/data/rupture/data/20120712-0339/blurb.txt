The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly updip: neither nodal plane is favored as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 150 km of the fault.
