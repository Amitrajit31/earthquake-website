The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are northwest and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The PGA rupture direction is updip while the PGV rupture direction is downdip. The nodal planes are projected on the upper and lower hemisphere for the PGA and PGV inversions, respectively. All the stations used are within 55 km of the fault.
