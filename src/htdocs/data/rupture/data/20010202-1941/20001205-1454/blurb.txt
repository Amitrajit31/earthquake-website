Both the PGA and PGV inversions obtain rupture directions that are downdip and southeast, and rupture velocities that are limited (&nu; ~ 0.92&beta;).  While the rupture directions are poorly constrained, both the PGAs and PGVs identify the NW-SE trending nodal plane as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
