Both the PGA and PGV rupture directions fail to identify the fault plane, but the <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/QuakeAddons/nc40215734.ncfm1.html" > USGS First Motion Focal Mechanism </a> and the rupture directions are poorly constrained due to the lack of stations to the west (offshore) of the earthquake.  Both the PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5-0.6&beta;).  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All stations used are within 120 km of the earthquake.
