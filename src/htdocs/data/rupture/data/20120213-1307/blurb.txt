The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of epicentral stations. Both rupture directions are updip and do not favor either nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 150 km of the fault.
