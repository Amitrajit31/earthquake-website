The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and adequately constrained despite the offshore location of the earthquake. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and strongly favor the EW striking nodal plane (that is, the Mendocino Fracture Zone) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. The uncertainty areas for the rupture directions wrap onto the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 150 km of the fault.
