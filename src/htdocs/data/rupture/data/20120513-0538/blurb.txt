The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; ~ &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained because of the shallow depth of the earthquake.  Both
rupture directions are nearly updip. It is unclear which nodal plane
is the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper
hemisphere. All the stations used are within 50 km of the fault.
