Both the PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; = 0.5 - 0.6&beta;) but are fairly well constrained. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the NW striking nodal plane (the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
