The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.55&beta;) but very poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations and the apparent downdip rupture. The PGV solution favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper and lower hemisphere for the PGA and PGV solutions, respectively. All the stations used are within 85 km of the fault.
