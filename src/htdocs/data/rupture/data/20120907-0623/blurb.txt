The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal with a slight downdip component and do not favor either nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
