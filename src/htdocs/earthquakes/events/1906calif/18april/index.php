<p>The California earthquake of April 18, 1906 ranks as one of
                    the most significant earthquakes of all time. Today, its importance
                    comes more from the wealth of scientific knowledge derived
                    from it than from its sheer size. Rupturing the northernmost
                    296 miles (477 kilometers) of the San Andreas fault from northwest of
                    San Juan Bautista to the triple junction at Cape Mendocino,
                    the earthquake confounded contemporary geologists with its
                    large, horizontal displacements and great rupture length.
                    Indeed, the significance of the fault and recognition of its
                    large cumulative offset would not be fully appreciated until
                    the advent of plate tectonics more than half a century later.
                    Analysis of the 1906 displacements and strain in the surrounding
                    crust led Reid (1910) to formulate his elastic-rebound theory
                    of the earthquake source, which remains today the principal
                    model of the earthquake cycle.</p>
<p>At almost precisely 5:12 a.m., local time, a foreshock occurred with sufficient force to be felt widely throughout the San
Francisco Bay area. The great earthquake broke loose some 20 to 25 seconds later, with an epicenter near San Francisco.
Violent shocks punctuated the strong shaking which lasted some 45 to 60 seconds. The earthquake was felt from southern
Oregon to south of Los Angeles and inland as far as central Nevada. The highest Modified Mercalli Intensities (MMI's)
of VII to IX paralleled the length of the rupture, extending as far as 80 kilometers inland from the fault trace. One important characteristic of the shaking intensity noted in Lawson's (1908) report was the clear correlation of intensity with
underlying geologic conditions. Areas situated in sediment-filled valleys sustained stronger shaking than nearby bedrock sites, and the strongest shaking occurred in areas where ground reclaimed from San Francisco Bay failed in the earthquake. Modern seismic-zonation practice accounts for the differences in seismic hazard posed by varying geologic conditions.</p>
<p>As a basic reference about the earthquake and the damage it
  caused, geologic observations of the fault rupture and shaking
  effects, and other consequences of the earthquake, the Lawson
  (1908) report remains the authoritative work, as well as arguably
  the most important study of a single earthquake. In the public's
  mind, this earthquake is perhaps remembered most for the fire
  it spawned in San Francisco, giving it the somewhat misleading
  appellation of the "San Francisco earthquake". Shaking damage,
  however, was equally severe in many other places along the
  fault rupture. The frequently quoted value of 700 deaths caused
  by the earthquake and fire is now believed to underestimate
  the total loss of life by a factor of 3 or 4. Most of the
  fatalities occurred in San Francisco, and 189 were reported
  elsewhere.</p>
