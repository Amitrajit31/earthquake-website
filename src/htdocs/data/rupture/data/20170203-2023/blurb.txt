The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly well-constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly updip and favor the N-S striking nodal plane as the fault plane. This plane is the auxiliary plane for the inversion results for most nearby earthquakes. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the fault.
