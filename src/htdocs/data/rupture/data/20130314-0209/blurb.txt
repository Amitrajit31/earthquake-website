The PGA and PGV directivities are weak (&nu; ~ 0.5&beta;) and poorly well-constrained, because of the shallow depth of the earthquake. The PGA rupture direction is nearly horizontal and strongly favors the N-S striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The PGV rupture direction is downdip and does not favor either nodal plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper and lower hemispheres for the PGA and PGV inversions, respectively. All the stations used are within 50 km of the fault.
