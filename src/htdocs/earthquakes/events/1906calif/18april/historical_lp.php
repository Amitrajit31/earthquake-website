<p> The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was the first scientifically studied
  earthquake in the U.S. The report written about the earthquake by the
  California State Earthquake Investigation Commission (SEIC), edited by
  Andrew Lawson (1908), is a landmark scientific document. However, this
  report was compiled from the observations of many investigators, and some
  areas were studied more thoroughly than others. </p>
<p> Careful scrutiny of the SEIC Report along with other historical documents
  (letters, original reports, historical maps, photographs, etc.) shows
  that the Loma Prieta area was relatively poorly studied after the 1906
  earthquake. Most of the observations in this region were made by G.A.
  Waring. Historical research shows that at the time of the earthquake Waring
  was a beginning Master's student working under J.C. Branner at Stanford
  University. Because Waring had little experience, was sent to a difficult
  area, and had only small-scale maps to work with, he made very few observations
  along the actual San Andreas Fault. Our research shows that most of the
  locations where "faulting" was reported are in fact nowhere near the San
  Andreas fault, and that Waring missed a section of the fault about 20
  km long. </p>
<p> There are three localities in the Loma Prieta area where enough information
  is known from 1906 that detailed comparisons can be made between the ground
  ruptures produced in the 1989 and 1906 earthquakes: A) The Wrights tunnel,
  B) Morrell Road, and C) The blacksmith shop near Burrell school. All of
  these locations are in the Summit Ridge area, where numerous ground ruptures
  occurred in 1989. These ground ruptures have been the subject of continuing
  controversy, with some scientists concluding that they are the result
  of shaking, and others concluding that they are instead the direct result
  of fault slip. </p>
<H2>A) Wrights Tunnel</H2>
<p> The Wrights tunnel is an abandoned railroad tunnel that crosses the
  San Andreas fault in the southern Santa Cruz Mountains in the vicinity
  of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, that was damaged and deformed during
  the 1906 earthquake. </p>
<p> A plot showing post-earthquake measurements made during reconstruction
  of the tunnel after the earthquake appears in the SEIC Report. The amount
  of offset shown on this plot (5 ft) has been used in several studies as
  being representative of the amount of fault offset along this segment
  of the San Andreas fault in 1906. However, historical research shows that
  different observers reported differing amounts of fault offset in the
  tunnel (ranging from 3.5 to 5 ft), and that the 5 ft given on the plot
  is not a surveyed measurement. In addition, the plot of the tunnel has
  been interpreted in several previous studies as evidence of a broad (about
  1 mi) zone of faulting beneath Summit Ridge. However, our analysis shows
  that this plot does not indicate a broad zone of faulting. </p>
<p> If our idea is correct, we can use these 1906 measurements to determine
  the total amount of fault offset, which we conclude was about 6 feet (1.8
  m). Most of this offset (60 - 85%, depending on whether the 3.5 or 5 feet
  reported across the fault is correct) occurred across a single fault plane;
  the remainder was distributed over a zone less than one quarter of a mile
  wide. </p>
<p> Most of the mapped cracks on Summit Ridge after the 1989 earthquake
  fall outside of the zone of faulting that occurred in 1906 in the Wrights
  tunnel. Similar widespread cracks on Summit Ridge occurred in 1906, but
  our analysis shows they were not associated with deformation of the tunnel
  below Summit Ridge. This indicates that in 1906 the Summit Ridge fractures
  were a surficial phenomenon, not a reflection of tectonic faulting. This
  is most likely the case for the 1989 fractures as well. </p>
<H2>B) Morrell Road</H2>
<p> One of the most perplexing photographs in the Lawson Report is this
  one, showing displacement in the opposite sense (left lateral) to the
  sense of offset across the San Andreas Fault (right lateral). We have
  examined the glass plate negative of this photograph and have determined
  that it is printed correctly, therefore, the left-lateral sense of displacement
  is true. In 1989, left-lateral faulting occurred across Morrell Road,
  near the crest of Summit Ridge. This occurred in the same location photographed
  in 1906. The nature of the rupture was very similar in 1906 and 1989.
  It was both left lateral and extensional. </p>
<p> A map of the Morrell fractures by H.R. Johnson appears in the SEIC Report,
  but it shows the fracture with right-lateral offset. Letters we have found
  that were written between the members of the SEIC suggest that Johnson's
  original map was changed so it would agree with the overall right-lateral
  faulting seen along the San Andreas. </p>
<p> A map made of the area (made by Sumaryanto and Johnson, in press) after
  the 1989 earthquake shows that the 1906 and 1989 features were very similar.
  We superimposed the two maps, using only the stream, the old road and
  the location of the house to guide the overlay, and found that these fractures
  are nearly identical, but the 1906 fracure was longer and had more offset. </p>
<H2>C) Blacksmith Shop</H2>
<p> A photo of ground rupture on Summit Ridge was taken very shortly after
  the earthquake early in the morning of April 18, 1906. The SEIC Report
  states that this photograph was taken in front of the blacksmith shop,
  near Burrell School. The blacksmith shop is gone, but the schoolhouse,
  now a private residence, is still standing. To understand the nature of
  this rupture, we needed to locate it precisely to determine its orientation.
<p> Two roads intersect near Burrell Schoolhouse, Loma Prieta Avenue and
  Summit Road. Both roads are shown on the oldest (1915) topographic map
  of the area. In addition, older county maps show a third road, Sears Road,
  intersecting Summit Road and Loma Prieta Avenue near Burrell school. The
  photograph could have been taken in either direction on any of the three
  roads; there are no definitive landmarks in the background to distinguish
  among these six possibilities. However, our analysis indicates that it
  was most likely taken in the morning, looking northwest on Summit Road. </p>
<p> According to a history book of this area (Payne, 1978) a blacksmith
  shop was located across the street from Burrell School, and was owned
  by Jack Smith. A deed of sale on file in the index of deeds at the Santa
  Clara County Recorder's office indicates that John W. Smith bought a piece
  of property near the intersection of Loma Prieta Avenue and Summit Road
  from A. E. Sears for $10.00 in 1903. The deed description, though lacking
  in precision, describes the property boundaries with respect to the roads
  and a small stream. The roads and stream are shown on surveyed maps of
  the area drawn in 1880, 1892, and 1903. We located the property purchased
  by Smith on a compilation of these historic maps as precisely as possible
  given the deed description. Given the location of the blacksmith shop,
  it's appearance on the right side of the 1906 photo, and the orientation
  of the shadows in the photo, the view in the photo must be either southeast
  on Sears Road in the afternoon or northwest on Summit Road in the morning.
<p> Several lines of evidence support a northwesterly view on Summit Road. </p>
  The deed indicates that by 1903 Sears Road was abandoned, yet the road
  shown in the 1906 photograph does not appear to be an abandoned road.
  Additionally, if the view is southeast on Sears Road, the small stream
  shown on old maps and described in the deed should be visible between
  the road and the blacksmith shop. Additional evidence for a northwesterly
  view up Summit Road is given by the shadows in the 1906 photograph. The
  caption accompanying this photograph reads: "Burrel corners on summit
  1 1/2 miles above Wrights station. Taken April 18, 1906 1 hr. after the
  earthquake by F. E. Caton, San Jose." In addition, the caption accompanying
  Waring's original report, referring to this photograph, reads: "Crack
  across road at blacksmith shop near Wright. Sulpher fumes rose here for
  several hours. Taken 6 a.m. April 18, 1906 by G. E. Caton, San Jose."
  If the photograph was taken at about 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning (the
  earthquake occurred at about 5:12 AM), the view must be northerly for
  the sun to cast the shadows in the direction seen in the photos. </p>
<p> We conclude that the two photographs were taken at the intersection
  of Summit Road and Loma Prieta Avenue, in the morning, looking northwest
  up Summit Road. Given the location and view direction of this photograph,
  the fracture must trend nearly north-south. The exact angle that the fracture
  makes with the road is not known, but it appears from the photographs
  to be intersecting the road at an angle of about 40&deg; &plusmn; 20&deg;. The old maps
  show Summit Road trending about N40W near this intersection; therefore,
  the trend of the fracture is around 000&deg; &plusmn; 20&deg;. This is parallel to some
  of the small fractures produced nearby in 1989, but not parallel to the
  overall regional trend of the San Andreas fault or most of the nearby
  fractures produced in 1989.</p>
<p> In addition to the large vertical displacement, this fracture had a
  significant extensional component, as is demonstrated by the gentleman
  standing in the fissure. Also, it may have had a right-lateral component:
  the edge of the road on the right side of the photo may show right-lateral
  offset across the fracture. Unfortunately, this part of the photograph
  is in shadow, and it is not possible to place much confidence in this
  observation. </p>
<p> The main trace of the San Andreas fault is located approximately 150
  m to the east of this location (see map above), and this fracture could
  represent surface rupture on a splay of the San Andreas fault. Alternatively,
  it could be a secondary shaking-related or ridge-top spreading feature
  similar to those produced in the Summit Road area in 1989, or it could
  be a landslide scarp. Maps of the active San Andreas fault zone show short
  fault traces with NW-NNW orientations crossing Summit Road at this location.
  The linear feature shown on the above map could be due to this rupture.
  If this is the case, then its linear nature makes it unlikely to be a
  landslide scarp. However, whether this fracture continued in a linear
  pattern or had an arcuate shape in 1906 is not discernible from the photographs.
  Without additional information about the nature of this fracture, it is
  not possible to be certain which of the three possibilities is correct.
  No large fractures occurred across Summit Road near the intersection of
  Loma Prieta Avenue in 1989, nor was any fracture in the immediate vicinity
  this large (the photographs and reports suggest about 1 m of vertical
  displacement, and several decimeters of extension in 1906). One possibility
  is that this fracture is associated with surface rupture along the San
  Andreas 1906, and did not break in 1989 because the San Andreas did not
  have surface rupture in 1989. The other fractures along Summit Ridge,
  such as the Morrell fracture, are due to strong shaking, and so moved
  during both earthquakes. </p>
<p> There are important similarities and differences between ground ruptures
  produced in 1906 and 1989. The ground ruptures in the Summit Ridge area
  were similar in both earthquakes. In at least one case, the Morrell Ranch
  fractures, the location is virtually identical, and the extensional nature
  and left-lateral sense of slip are the same. However, the amount of displacement
  on the larger 1906 fracture was more than two times greater than the displacement
  on the northeastern 1989 fracture. The descriptions of other off-fault
  ground ruptures in 1906 indicate that these features were common in the
  Summit Road area, as they were in 1989, and shared the same characteristics
  as the fissures produced in 1989: left- and right-lateral slip and large
  extensional and vertical displacements along north to northwest trending
  fractures. However the locations of other 1906 fractures in the Summit
  Road area are not well enough known to make specific comparisons with
  those produced in 1989. Unlike the 1989 earthquake, the 1906 earthquake
  appears to have produced similar phenomena well outside the southern Santa
  Cruz Mountains area. </p>
