The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; = 0.77&beta; and &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but very poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions slightly favor the N-S striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
