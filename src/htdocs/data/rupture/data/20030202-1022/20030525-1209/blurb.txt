The PGA and PGV rupture directions are well-constrained and almost directly updip, and both solutions obtain fast rupture velocities (&nu; ~ 0.84&beta;). For this pathological case, the fault plane cannot be identified, although the PGA solution favors the NW-SE nodal plane (that is, the Rodgers Creek fault).  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
