The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and well-constrained, and the rupture velocities are very fast (&nu; ~ 0.8&beta;).  The rupture directions are nearly horizontal: it is interesting to compare the SE directivity in this earthquake to the NW directivity in the M5.1 earthquake that occurred on 8/12/98.  Both solutions clearly identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
