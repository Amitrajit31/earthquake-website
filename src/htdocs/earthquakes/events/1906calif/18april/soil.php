<p>Reports showed that damage was greatest on artificially filled ground, marshy ground and areas of incoherent sands. Areas that suffered the least damage were on rock.</p>

<p>Although miles from the fault, many San Francisco's streets were rippled and torn. Shown here  is a crack near 18th Street looking east to Folsom Street in San Francisco.

<p>Unfortunately, these reports did not have a major effect on redevelopment of the Marina and areas south of Market Street in San Francisco after the earthquake, and the same areas sustained heavy damage during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989.</p>
