  Yes, the Geysers area experienced many triggered earthquakes after the Landers
  event. In fact, since then seismologists have observed that activity in the
  Geysers area often picks up after large earthquakes elsewhere in California.
  One similarity between the volcanic center at Long Valley caldera and the Geysers
  area is that both have hot rocks. In fact, the Geysers area includes a geothermal
  power plant that turns the heat from these rocks into electricity. The heat
  in both areas may have something to do with why there are triggered earthquakes
  there.

  The magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake took place in the desert east of Los
  Angeles. The seismograms were recorded by the USGS's Northern California Seismic
  Network on instruments in Long Valley, Parkfield, and the Geysers.
