Both the PGA and PGV rupture directions are nearly updip, but the rupture velocities are different (&nu; = 0.82&beta; and &nu; = 0.70&beta;, respectively).  Both solutions favor the EW striking nodal plane as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake.
