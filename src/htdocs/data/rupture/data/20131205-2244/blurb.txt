The PGA and PGV directivities are very poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are downdip, and the rupture plane cannot be inferred from the inversions. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
