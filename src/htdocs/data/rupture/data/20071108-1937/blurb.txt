The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and indicate the E-W striking nodal plane as the fault plane.  Both solutions have limited rupture velocities (&nu; &equiv; 0.92 &beta;) and strongly updip ruptures: the rupture directions almost exactly coincide with the takeoff angle to CSMIP station 89255 in Fortuna.  The waveforms for this recording (see the <a href="http://www.strongmotioncenter.org/cgi-bin/ncesmd/iqr_dist.pl?IQRID=Ferndale_8Nov2007&SFlag=0&Flag=2"> NCESMD data report</a>) contain simple pulses with strong stopping phases.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
