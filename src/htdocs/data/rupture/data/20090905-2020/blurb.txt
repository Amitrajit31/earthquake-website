The PGV rupture velocity is moderate, but the PGA rupture velocity is limited (&nu; &equiv;  0.92&beta;). Both solutions identify the south-dipping nodal plane as the fault plane, but the PGV rupture direction is further from the nodal plane. The nodal planes are  projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
