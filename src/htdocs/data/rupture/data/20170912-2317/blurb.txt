The PGA and PGV directivities are limited and moderate (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta; and ~ 0.7&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of offshore stations. The PGA rupture direction favors the E-W striking nodal plane as the fault plane, while the PGV rupture direction is ambiguous. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 130 km of the fault.
