Both the PGA and PGV solutions have updip rupture directions: the PGA velocity is limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), and  the PGV rupture velocity (&nu; =  0.78&beta;) is moderate.   Both inversions indicate the NS striking plane as the fault plane.  This rupture direction is distinct from the updip ruptures that we obtained for most strike-slip earthquakes at the Geysers. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 70 km of the epicenter.
