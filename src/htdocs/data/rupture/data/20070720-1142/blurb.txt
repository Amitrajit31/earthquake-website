The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and well-constrained, and the rupture velocities are very fast (&nu; = 0.86&beta;), indicating that the rupture was nearly unilateral.  The rupture direction is northwest and updip, so that the earthquake was felt most strongly in Berkeley.  Both solutions clearly identify the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
