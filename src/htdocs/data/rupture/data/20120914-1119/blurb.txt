The PGA and PGV directivities are apparently strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of offshore stations. Both rupture directions are nearly horizontal and favor the SW-NE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper and lower hemispheres for the PGA and PGV inversions, respectively. All the stations used are within 120 km of the fault.
