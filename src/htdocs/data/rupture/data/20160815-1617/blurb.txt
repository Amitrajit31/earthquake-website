The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations and sufficient azimuthal coverage. Both rupture directions are downdip and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
