The PGA directivity is strong (&nu; = 0.84&beta;), and the PGV directivity is limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;), but both directivities are very poorly constrained. The PGA rupture direction lies between the two nodal planes, while the PGV rupture direction is downdip and favors the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively. All the stations used are within 70 km of the fault.
