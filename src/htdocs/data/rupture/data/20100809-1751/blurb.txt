The PGA and PGV directivities are strong and the rupture velocities are limited ((&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and well-constrained. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and indicate the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) is the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 70 km of the earthquake.
