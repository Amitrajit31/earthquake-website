The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are partly updip and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the San Andreas fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes from the NCSN focal mechanism are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
