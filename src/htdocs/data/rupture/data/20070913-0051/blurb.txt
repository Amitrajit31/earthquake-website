In spite of the lack of stations, both solutions identify the SW dipping nodal plane as the fault plane.  Both solutions have limited rupture velocities (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) and pooorly resolved rupture directions because there are no stations in the direction of rupture.  The identification of the SW dipping fault plane agrees with the Eaton's (1990) interpretation of the 1983 Coalinga main shock.  The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere.  All the stations used are within 100 km of the earthquake: we extended the limiting distance to stabilize the solution.
