Both the PGA and PGV solutions obtain downdip ruptures, but the PGA rupture velocity (&nu; = 0.62&beta;) is more realistic and the PGA rupture direction is aligned with the NE dipping nodal plane. While the agreement between the PGA and PGV solutions is poor, the correspondance of the rupture direction with the aftershock locations is striking. The nodal planes are projected on the lower hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the earthquake.
