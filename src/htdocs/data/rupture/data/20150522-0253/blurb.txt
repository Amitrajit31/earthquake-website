The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.7&beta;), but poorly constrained, owing to the lack of nearby stations. The addition of station NAPC, ~1 km north of the epicenter, did not improve the solution. Both rupture directions are updip. Neither nodal plane is clearly favored as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 90 km of the fault.
