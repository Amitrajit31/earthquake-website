The PGA and PGV directivities are strong (&nu; ~ 0.9&beta;) and very well constrained, owing to the large number of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are partly updip and strongly favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane (that is, the Hayward fault) as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 40 km of the fault.
