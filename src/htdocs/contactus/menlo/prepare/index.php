    <h3>Protecting Your Family From Earthquakes&mdash;The Seven Steps to Earthquake Safety</h3>
    <h5 style="color:#933">Part of the <em>Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country</em> Series</h5>
    <p>This handbook is a multilingual, abridged version of <em>Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country</em>. It is available in two editions: English and Spanish; and English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean. It is provided here because of the importance of preparing for earthquakes before they happen. Experts say it is very likely there will be a damaging San Francisco Bay Area earthquake in the next 30 years and that it will strike without warning. It may be hard to find the supplies and services we need after this earthquake. You will need to provide for your family until help arrives. To keep our loved ones and our community safe, we must prepare now.
