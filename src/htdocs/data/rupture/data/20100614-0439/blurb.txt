The rupture direction from the PGA inversion is aligned with the NW-SE striking nodal plane, and the rupture velocity is moderate, &nu; = 0.73&beta;. The rupture direction from the PGV inversion is nearly vertical and does not coincide with a nodal plane, and the rupture velocity is limited at &nu;&equiv; 0.92&beta;. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 60 km of the earthquake.
