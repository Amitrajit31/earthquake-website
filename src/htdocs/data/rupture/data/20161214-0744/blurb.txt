The PGA and PGV directivities are limited (&nu; &equiv; 0.92&beta;) but adequately constrained, owing to the set of nearby stations. Both rupture directions are nearly  updip and favor the vertical NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 80 km of the fault.
