	If you haven't done the <a href="distance.php">Distance
  Effects </a> topic yet, you should do that one first.
</p>
<p>
	When learning about how distance affects shaking we learned
  that the waves lose energy as they travel. How fast they lose
  energy depends on the type of rock they are traveling through.
  For instance, very solid granites will transmit energy better
  than the chewed up rocks we find in fault zones. It's almost
  like the waves traveling through the chewed up rocks are traveling
  further and so they lose more energy and especially more of
  the high frequencies.

<p>
	Below are two seismograms, or records of ground shaking,
  you can listen to. They come from the same earthquake but
  were recorded on two different seismometers. Both seismometers
  were about 5 miles from the earthquake, but one is on very
  solid rock while the other is in the fault zone. That's why
  they have different pitches. The volume has been adjusted
  to the same level so concentrate on the pitch to tell the
  difference. Click the sideways triangle (or play button) to
  hear the sound.
