  Yes, seismometer you picked was only 6 miles from the earthquake and the other
  one was 75 miles from the earthquake. Because high frequencies don't travel
  well the close seismometer had a higher pitch.

  After a newsworthy earthquake some people will describe it as a "sharp jolt"
  while others say it had a "rolling motion." The people who feel the "sharp jolt"
  are generally closer to the earthquake than those that felt the "rolling motion."

  However, there are other factors. For instance, people near the tops of tall
  buildings will feel a "rolling motion" while those outside will feel more of
  a "sharp jolt."

  This particular earthquake was a magnitude 5.1 event on the San Andreas fault
  near Parkfield, California. The two seismograms were recorded by the U.C. Berkeley
  Seismological Laboratory on their instruments in Parkfield and Hollister, California.
